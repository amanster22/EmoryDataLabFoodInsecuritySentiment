The Community Food Center established in Marieta will operate as a food pantry, directly distributing food to local families. The new site is expected to help approximately 700 families weekly and will continue to scale up as needed. 

The new CFC is made possible in part by the generous support of the
following founding donors: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Publix Super Markets Charities,

ATLANTA – The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) is urging Georgians to be cautious about eating pre-cut cantaloupe if they cannot verify its source. At least five people in Georgia have become infected with Salmonella likely due to eating the contaminated cantaloupe. Across the country, 117 people have also been sickened, nearly half requiring hospitalization. The Salmonella cases reported in Georgia range in age from 1-81. The cases are from different areas of the state, not concentrated in any one place. One individual was hospitalized but has since been released. The recalled cantaloupe is sold in Georgia at Sprouts Farmers Market, Trader Joes, and Kroger stores. The cantaloupe is sold as pre-cut chunks or in fruit mixes. Whole cantaloupes that are also part of the recall may have a sticker that says “Malichita” or “Rudy”, with the number 4050 and “Product of Mexico/produit du Mexique. ” More information about the recall can be found on the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-Salmonella-cantaloupes-november-2023. Most people infected with Salmonella experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps and recover without treatment in 4-7 days. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is concerned about this outbreak because the illnesses associated with it are severe, including fevers higher than 102°F, not being able to keep down liquids, and diarrhea that lasts more than three days without improving. Individuals who may have eaten the recalled cantaloupe should contact their healthcare provider if they have severe Salmonella symptoms. Do not eat pre-cut cantaloupe or whole cantaloupe if you don’t know whether it is Malichita or Rudy brand. If you have any of the recalled cantaloupe, throw it away or return it to the store where you purchased it. Rinsing pre-cut cantaloupe does not remove all germs if it is already contaminated with Salmonella. Rinsing whole cantaloupes can reduce the number of germs but it does not remove all germs. Germs on the surface of cantaloupes can then get onto the knife and inside the fruit when you cut the cantaloupe. Wash items and surfaces that may have touched the cantaloupe using hot soapy water or a dishwasher.

We&#39;re all feeling the sting of the higher prices right now at the grocery store. So where can you get the most for your money? Love alive. Liza Lucas went to four different chains with the same grocery list to find out who offered the best price for Marcia Smith. A run to get groceries is all about strategy. I really started to stop buying in bulk so much like I literally have to purchase stuff week by week, the past few years have been hard on family food budgets and while inflation has leveled off in the past 12 months, grocery prices remain high shoppers like John Horn continue to adjust to the higher cost. Well, I always look for deals. So yes, I look for things that were on sale. A little bit more things that were closer to the expiration dates. If we knew we were going to use them soon. Here at 11 live, we set out to determine which store offers the best prices to help you get the most for your money. We&#39;re going to store with the same shopping list looking for basics like bread, milk eggs, things like that. And where possible. We&#39;re gonna buy store brands. Let&#39;s go. I popped by four major chain stores, Walmart, Publix, Kroger and Ingles, which have the largest market share in Metro Atlanta. According to data from the chain store guide and at each stop I shop for the same eight items in the same amount. A 40 ounce jar of peanut butter, a pound of 8020 ground beef, a dozen white eggs. Ok. We gotta get that milk, basic white bread. Remember we&#39;re gonna grab store brand where possible a frozen cheese pizza, a box of mac and cheese. Ok. We&#39;ve got our bananas. Let&#39;s see how it adds up. We came back with all of our bags and checked our receipts overall. We did the best at Walmart spending just over $21 before tax. Next was Kroger where we spent $25.12 followed by Ingles with $27.84. The priciest bill was Publix where we spent just over $29 and approximately $8 difference. We did notice an advantage to shopping around. For example, we found a sale price on ground beef the day we shopped at Ingles while we scored the cheapest cheese pizza at Kroger. Those we spoke with also avoid sticking to just one store these days. They&#39;re watching sales and monitoring prices definitely like kind of shop around and find where I&#39;m going get things at the, at the best value. And it&#39;s kind of crazy. I never had to do that before, but you really have to watch what you&#39;re spending because it will get costly. Liza Lucas 11. A live news. Ok. So our experiment was simple. We shopped minus special coupons or special store app. So we later followed up with the stores for their recommended ways to save. That includes tapping into the store websites for recipes, digital coupons and special deals which can potentially increase your savings.

Yeah, yeah. Shit going up. I can't even go to the grocery store. That's $200 and that's all what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna put for the night. $200 might last you two weeks back in the night. I used to be a king or going with $25 a leg. Get a whole week. Where a week? There'll be a crowd being some chicken. Yeah. Some pack of noodles for you. He's got that. Yeah. $25. Oh, that's nice.

A heads up this morning if you usually take Marta to the airport next month, that will not be an option. Beginning on April 8th, the airport Marta station will close for more than a month. 11 alive. Jerry Carnes explains why and what this means for you. It&#39;s time for major renovations at the transit station where passengers are delivered to the world&#39;s busiest airport. It could add time to your next trip here. I take Marta because it&#39;s convenient. Um and it&#39;s cheap. Uh And so if they&#39;re gonna take away the convenience factor that leaves the cheapness, but like how much is my time worth Marta&#39;s airport station will close for six weeks. Beginning April 8th, crews are replacing floor tile and preparing to install a new canopy prep. Work is underway to a new elevator. Marta&#39;s Chief capital Officer says closing the station at nights and on weekends was an option. But that would last if we, if we looked at the complete duration of the project, it would last, you know, 1718 months longer. Marta will continue to take passengers to the college Park station, a shuttle will then deliver them to the airport. The agency says plan on an added 30 minutes for your trip. It&#39;s not a problem for Timothy White. I&#39;m retired so I got plenty of time so they can&#39;t rush me. Joanna Satterwhite appreciates the advanced warning. I&#39;m glad that you told me so that I&#39;m not blindsided. Next time I come to Atlanta, there&#39;s time to plan for the disruptions coming in. April that could add time to your next trip to the airport. This work is all in part of a renovation project in preparation for the 2026 World Cup.

will consider authorizing A1 and a
half million dollar grant to improve access
to quality food. This is through Invest Atlanta. The money would also
help in creating jobs and community development
in areas needing to access groceries
and pharmacies. That funding could help areas like Southeast Atlanta, where it&#39;s now temporarily
lost access
to a grocery store that people
waited years for. Publix is closed indefinitely ms after opening to address a lackf access to fresh food and grocer. Ariana Muniz joining
us live outside the Publix on Hank Aaron
Drive this morning. Ariana that area long been known as a food desert. This was supposed to help and now it&#39;s like one step forward, 2 steps back. That&#39;s right, Cheryl. The publics and the garage connected to the grocery store e closed until repairs can be don. In the meantime, people are left without a nearby grocery store. And people who live in this area as well as city officials, they are concerned about the vod this could recreate
in this community. So I was hoping to, like, pop in the grocery store on the way home. It was a failed trip to the groy store for Kenisha Cantrell. Cantrell was attempting
to make
a stop at the Publix on Hank Aaron Dri, but the store is now closed indefinitely after part of the parking lot collapsed on Saturd. So it&#39;s interesting that they ce the whole store when they have a huge parking lot for people to use. Firefighters say a crane ws driven up to the second floor of a parking garage when it fell, rupturing a water line and causing a diesel leak. One person was hurt. Cantrell says this collapse is t just inconvenient but could be detrimental to the community. Af I was, I was I didn&#39;t have a cad I had to take public transporta. I even looked at it one time. It would take me like 30 minutes to an hour just to get to a grocery store, a
fresh food source. This is also a concern for the , as a store just opened
a few months ago in the Summerhill neighborhood
to address the lack of accessible
fresh food options. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens sain a statement his administration s worried about the impact this wl have on the safety and
access to food. Pharmacy services in the communy and that there is no exact timee for a full resolution, but the companies involved are considering a partial reopening of the store and parking garage. Branch properties, who owns the shopping center whe the public supermarket is locat, say they believe an
unauthorized person unaffiliated with ownership droa crane on the top level
of the parking lot, ignoring weight limit warning s. They go on to say that
they&#39;re working with authorities and
that construction will begin as soon as possible. Now 11 Alive reached out to Publix to see if they can give us some insight on a timeline ad when this public store reopened. We reached out multiple times, but we&#39;re still waiting

The musician and entrepreneur made sharing his love of warm tropical places his lifes work . Stephanie Elam looks back at his journey to Margaritaville and all of the places in between. Margarita. Jimmy Buffett&#39;s laid
back songs captured the feel of lazy days in paradi. Some call this signature sound Gulf and Western, a mix of couny and Caribbean music. I love the Caribbean through a sort
of a strange way. My grandfather is a sailing
ship captain, and he sang the calypso songs. So all this sort of amalgamatiof material came in and came back , and I learned to be a
performer
and that gave me the vehicle to do it. Buffett was born Christmas Day 6 on the Gulf Coast and Southern. Mississippi and raised in the port city of Mobile, AL, he began his career making
country music, but only really found
his musical voice after moving to Key West in the. Changes in attitude,
Nothing remains. By the same, His time
among the colorful characters there helped inspire his tropical style and eventualy led to his landmark 1977 album Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes and its famous hit song, Margaritaville. Now I think. It could be my fau, but Buffett&#39;s greatest musical success was on the concert stag, not the charts. He made hundreds of millions of dollars touring over the decade, supported by his legion of diehd fans known as Parrot Heads. The audience is just so
much fun for
me to look at. I mean, there&#39;s
entertaining to me, as I hope I am to them. His music may have been laid ba, but Buffett brought so much energy to his life. He piloted airplanes, wrote best selling books, raised funds for Democratic candidates and amassed a fortune estimated at $1 billion through his Margaritaville lifestyle br, which included restaurants, hotels, resorts and casinos. Like his music, it was all geard toward capturing the magic of te tropical places Buffett love be. From New Orleans to the Gulf Coast down into St. Barts and other places, I stilln find magic in most of those plas where people think there
isn&#39;t any left.

This is really a big
deal if you know anything about that area, 11 li. Brittany Kleinpeter has more on how this area has transformed or the years and how critical this grocery store is for the people who live in that community. It was really just like a an laf nothingness. Located in the heart of downtown, only blocks from the Georgia State Stadium, sits the community of Summerhil. When we first moved here, it wa. UKIP see that there was movement and that there was definite ene, but it was basically
like a neglected community. Longtime residents
like Nicole and her husband say they
have gone without for years. People were here. It was just that a lot
of the infrastructure and those things that make a ciy were not here. And that&#39;s why both leaders and residents recognize the opening of a public grocery store means more than just a supermarket coming to a neighborhood. Fresh food access is very import to the vitality of communities. When we moved here is definitely a food desert, and as we&#39;ve gone through the many layers of movet and development within Summerhi, we&#39;ve seen so much
growth and
this is just adding to the growth. Justo give you an idea of how much ths area has transformed over the y, this is what it looked
like on Georgia Ave. right around the corner
from where the grocery store now stands
10 years ago. Over the last few years, you can see the dramatic
transformation in the area from murals to new construction to what it looks l. Now today with multiple restaurants lining the block, look historically of what Summer Hill was and
to the community, especially to the African Amerin and the black community what it. Just to see Summer
Hill really coming back and return to his resurgene of who it is and what it was is just a beautiful thing. Many believe the grocery store, which will include a pharmacy aa Piedmont urgent care is a welcod into what was and the emergence of what Summer Hill will now be. Brittany Kleinpeter 11 Alive News Mayor Andre Dickens says. As his administration has plans to bring grocery stores to other area food deserts as well, he says up next is Campbellton .

Don White is live from Atlantic Loring Heights Apartments along Deering Rd. She has the very latest on this developing situation. Don. Jeff less than an hour ago, police told me what happened here at this apartment complex was a targeted shooting that started from a dispute. They believe the victim is between 25 and 30 years old, and right now the suspect is on the run. Let&#39;s take a look at some video that we shot earlier when we first got here. Atlanta police say someone shot the man at the Atlantic Loring Heights Apartments around 2:30 this afternoon. 11 live cameras were rolling when investigators put a brown rifle in a police vehicle. We&#39;ve seen about a dozen officers out collecting evidence and talking to neighbors. Nicholas Viola lives across the street and says this is a normally quiet neighborhood where everybody knows each other. I would say that we don&#39;t have a lot of crime here for the most part. Um, we&#39;ve had some. Interesting there&#39;s a 3 way intersection where there&#39;s a lot of action. Whether it&#39;s usually car accidents, but a shooting that&#39;s. Yeah, I don&#39;t know. I got a 2 year old daughter, which is kind of scary. Police say the suspect&#39;s vehicle is a silver Nissan Maxima. They also say that neither the victim nor the suspect lived here at this apartment complex. We are going to continue following this developing story and bring you the latest developments tonight at 11.

Karis Belger is live for us in Centennial Olympic Park. Karis. That&#39;s nice. Cloud cover creates a pretty perfect scenario for runners if you&#39;re going to run that kind of a distance. You know, one of the runners who just crossed the finish line told me that one thing he was glad about was the fact it was not raining while he was trying to make his way through the entire course. And just to give you an idea, they&#39;re about 9000 registered participants for this race this morning. Just look over my shoulder. You can kind of see where the finish line is. People are making their way across that finish line. They look a little tired, as they should be because they are not only passing through major Atlanta landmarks starting in Centennial Olympic Park and going through Piedmont Park and then taking away. To the HBC campuses, so Spelman and Morehouse before coming all the way back here, but they are having to do so to try and keep perfect time. A few people were telling me that they have their own personal records they&#39;re trying to break and we just heard that one of the elite runners possibly broke the record for the fastest half marathon run in the state. So that&#39;s really exciting. We&#39;re hoping to catch him as soon as he is finished on stage. They&#39;re giving out trophies right now, but a lot of people who are just excited to finish but also do so. A lot of rain pouring down because last year was pretty wet.

Traffic moving smoothly. Let&#39;s hope it stays that way. Crews right now working hard to make sure that does happen as we are expecting some ice. There is a best case and a worst case scenario for drivers over the next few days. Georgia dot preparing for the worst case just in case for those who will be out on the roads, sub freezing temperatures and hot fresh pizza delivered to your home. Alex figures that&#39;s the perfect combination, so he&#39;s hoping for a spike in business Friday. He&#39;s not worried about any patches of ice on the roads getting between him and his customers. I feel like if you know what you&#39;re doing, you can drive. Moments after I spoke with Alex more, Georgia dot trucks headed to the interstates and state highways to treat the surfaces with one coat after another of brine to prevent the services from freezing. Hoping the predicted rain is brief and that the winds evaporate the moisture from the roads. That would be the best case scenario. I asked 11 alive meteorologist Nicole Hartford. How far would you have to drive to get away from the threats of ice on the road this weekend? Friday morning you&#39;d have to drive to South Georgia to get away from. Freezing conditions, but by Saturday morning you&#39;d have to drive to South Florida to guarantee your roads are ice free. Patsy Jones of Atlanta has a full tank of gas and a new car battery and plenty of food at home. She&#39;s staying right here, certain she can handle the roads and any ice patches. You just gotta go slow and easy and you know. Don&#39;t get no hurry and don&#39;t slam on no brakes. And longtime drivers in North Georgia will remember that those county roads and city streets that people take to get to and from the state highways may not be treated at all for ice in Atlanta. John Sherick, 11, alive news. If you are nervous to drive in this Arctic blast, Marta has you covered. They&#39;re planning to operate as normal tomorrow. That&#39;s according to this tweet sent out today. Just make sure you check Marta&#39;s alerts page in case anything changes.

#SAFEkids #Fultoncounty #carseats #carseatsafety"," Hi, I'm Charlene Simmons with Fulton County Board of Health, Safe Kids Fulton Coordinator. Safe Kids Fulton is an injury prevention program where we focus on all things safe for children. Our focus groups are water, fire, bike safety, traffic, pedestrian, and child passenger safety seats. Today we're gonna mainly focus on installing and talking about car seat safety. When looking for a car seat, first look at your budget. Do not spend outside of your norm and what you can afford because somebody said that was the best. We always focus on good, better, and best. Good staying in the parameters of what the law states and that you should have a car seat and that's for every passenger in the car, as well as a seat belt, as well as what suits your nature for your child. When purchasing a car seat, you want to look at the height of the child, the tallness or the shortness, the weight of the child, whether it's an infant, a toddler, a three year old, a four year old, or an eight year old. All of that goes into the size and the weight because the manufacturer's determined what's best for the car seat by the size, the weight, and the height of the child. If it does not come with the car seat and it's not manufactured by the car seat, don't use it. I repeat, if it does not come with the car seat and it's not manufactured by the maker of the car seat, do not use it. Before I do it for a demonstration of how to properly install a car seat, we want to look at a couple of key points. When installing a car seat, you want to focus on the belt path, you have the front pull with facing belt path as well as the rear facing belt path. You want to take the seat belt through the closest to the back of the seat. So if this is front facing, you're gonna use the top belt path. If it's rear facing, you're gonna use the smaller belt path. You also want to focus on your harness, your belt clip, and the adjustments of your harness and belt clip. When installing a car seat, and today we're gonna use a convertible car seat because it can go rear facing as well as you can turn it around for a forward facing. You still want to use the correct belt path. So since we're installing this one as a rear facing car seat, we're using the belt path closest to the seat. And you want to make sure that it is as tight as you can get it. You're gonna place your weight into the car seat, pulling back on the seat belt up and security. So that once you finish, the car seat does not move any more than an inch. This one is installed perfectly. Also, you want to make sure that the back seat, the front of the back seat, isn't up against the car seat. You don't want anything that's resting on the car seat to secure it in. You want to make sure that the seat belt is the only thing that's securing the car seat into the car. Now, one of the good things about having a convertible as you see, we now have a forward facing. And again, you use the same belt path that are closest to the back of the seat. So we're gonna use the top belt path. Run the seat belt through, pull it, put in your weight into the seat belt and pulling up, making sure that it still doesn't move more than an inch. One key thing to a forward facing seat, you have to use what we call the tether. The tether stabilizes the top of the car seat so that if you're hit from the back or you run into the back someone, the top part of the car seat doesn't just flop all over the place. Things to remember about when purchasing a car seat for your child. Look at the tags, the labels on the car seat. Remember the height, weight, developmental level and make sure that it fits your car and not any car. Also, you want to make sure that you're getting, you'll know if you're putting it forward facing or rear facing. You wanna make sure that you're placing the seat belt through the correct belt path, rear facing, forward facing. And when you're having it forward facing that you're using your tether for stability. If you would like to learn more about child pasture safety seat installation, you can reach me Charlene Simmons, Fulton County Board of Health Safe Kids Coordinator at 404-612-4236. Also my email address Charlene.Simmons at Fulton County, g-a.gov. Come join us on August 9th or August 27th, right here at 5829, Campbellton Road, the public shopping class, where Safe Kids Fulton is partnering with City of South Fulton Fire Department.

Ron DeSantis regarding an alleged pay-to-play scheme with the grocery store chain Publix. Will the network be held accountable for its false narrative? In addition to this, the media continues to spread the lie that Georgia's new election law is ""Jim Crow 2.0,"" causing MLB to pull the All-Star Game from being held in Atlanta. CNN's Jim Acosta talks about ""post-Trump stress disorder,"" proving even more that the MSM is struggling to move on from Donald Trump. We found out the identity of the man who ran his car into the U.S. Capitol last week, killing one officer, but the identity doesn't match the media's narrative, so you won't be hearing too much about it. And lastly, NPR toys with the idea of wearing masks even after the pandemic ends to help prevent flu and cold transmissions.

As you prep for your Publix Atlanta Marathon, Half Marathon and 5K, remember to fuel for America's Marathon Weekend. Allie Schaich, Starla Garcia, Melissa Fairey and Cali Werner are four U.S. Olympic Team Trials - Marathon qualifiers who train together in Houston, Texas. They also make a mean and delicious gnocchi recipe together. Full recipe below with all ingredients available at Publix. Save some time on this big recipe by using Instacart. Gnocchi ingredients: 4 lbs potatoes 3 cups flour 2 eggs 2 tsp salt Gnocchi Steps: - Rinse and boil potatoes until they're soft and you can puncture them easily with a fork. Drain and peel when cool enough to touch. - Cut potatoes in half and pass through a ricer. Let sit until at room temperature. - Mix the eggs with the potatoes in one bowl. Mix the flour with the salt in another. Slowly incorporate the flour into the egg/potato mixer until it forms a dough. - Once the dough is formed into a ball in the mixing bowl, cover a clean surface with flour and pull off a lemon sized piece. - Incorporating the flour that's on your working surface, gently knead the dough ball and roll it into a ""snake"" that's about 3/4 inch in diameter. Then, cut the ""snake"" into roughly inch-long pieces - this is the gnocchi! - If desired, use a gnocchi board to add texture and depth to the pieces. - Add gnocchi to a large pot of boiling water. When the gnocchi rises to the top, take it out and saute in some olive oil until the outsides turn light brown. This adds texture. - Cover with homemade marinara sauce, pesto, Parmesan cheese, or a sauce of your choice and enjoy! Pasta sauce ingredients: 2 tbsp olive oil 1 medium onion, finely diced 3-5 cloves garlic 2 tsp dried basil 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar 2 tsp butter 28oz crushed tomatoes 1/4 cup water Pasta Sauce Steps: - Saute onions for about three minutes, stirring frequently. Add garlic and cook for an additional two minutes. Add basil, salt, and sugar, then butter. Stir to combine. - Add 1/2 can of the crushed tomatoes, stir and scrape the bits from the bottom of the pan. Add remaining tomatoes and water. -Simmer for 10 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally!",,no longer populated,,2020-02-25T16:00:00.000Z,post data removed,,488.0,18.0,5.0,0.0,,,

This is really a big
deal if you know anything about that area, 11 li. Brittany Kleinpeter has more on how this area has transformed or the years and how critical this grocery store is for the people who live in that community. It was really just like a an laf nothingness. Located in the heart of downtown, only blocks from the Georgia State Stadium, sits the community of Summerhil. When we first moved here, it wa. UKIP see that there was movement and that there was definite ene, but it was basically
like a neglected community. Longtime residents
like Nicole and her husband say they
have gone without for years. People were here. It was just that a lot
of the infrastructure and those things that make a ciy were not here. And that&#39;s why both leaders and residents recognize the opening of a public grocery store means more than just a supermarket coming to a neighborhood. Fresh food access is very import to the vitality of communities. When we moved here is definitely a food desert, and as we&#39;ve gone through the many layers of movet and development within Summerhi, we&#39;ve seen so much
growth and
this is just adding to the growth. Justo give you an idea of how much ths area has transformed over the y, this is what it looked
like on Georgia Ave. right around the corner
from where the grocery store now stands
10 years ago. Over the last few years, you can see the dramatic
transformation in the area from murals to new construction to what it looks l. Now today with multiple restaurants lining the block, look historically of what Summer Hill was and
to the community, especially to the African Amerin and the black community what it. Just to see Summer
Hill really coming back and return to his resurgene of who it is and what it was is just a beautiful thing. Many believe the grocery store, which will include a pharmacy aa Piedmont urgent care is a welcod into what was and the emergence of what Summer Hill will now be. Brittany Kleinpeter 11 Alive News Mayor Andre Dickens says. As his administration has plans to bring grocery stores to other area food deserts as well, he says up next is Campbellton . Martin Luther King Junior Drive and other Southside areas.
