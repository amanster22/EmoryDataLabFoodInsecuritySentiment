Slavery was legal. Jim Crow was legal. The US Government paying reparations to white enslavers and not to the enslaved was legal. Prison slavery is still legal. The lesson is‚Äîdo not let legality and power be a measure of morality and justice. And this is the lesson to remember now as the new MAGA government dismantles every semblance of a functioning society under the guise of ‚Äúlaw and order.‚Äù Their acts are not only likely illegal, they are absolutely immoral and unjust. And unless we act with immediate urgency the damage done will be irreparable. What are these injustices, and how do we work with meaningful action to counter them? Let‚Äôs Address This.

In just a few weeks, the Trump administration has unleashed some of the most sweeping assaults on democracy, civil rights, and global stability in modern history. Every move has been calculated to entrench authoritarian control, whether by punishing law enforcement officials who prosecuted insurrectionists, dismantling public health protections, handing over government power to billionaires, criminalizing diversity and thought, or upending global trade agreements. These are not the actions of a democratic leader‚Äîthey are the hallmarks of a fascist regime.

Here are seven of the most dangerous actions Trump has taken so far‚Äîand likewise‚Äîwhat actions can take to counter and protect from the harm he is causing.

1. Handing an Unelected Billionaire Control Over Americans‚Äô Financial Data
Trump‚Äôs Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessant, has granted Elon Musk full access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems. Musk‚Äôs cronies have reportedly blocked out government officials from their own systems. This means Musk, a private billionaire with no official government position, now has direct access to:

Federal grant and loan distributions

Social Security and Medicare benefits records

Government contractor payments, including those that compete directly with Musk‚Äôs companies

This is blatant corruption. Musk previously publicly pressured Trump to fire the FAA administrator after the agency fined SpaceX for safety violations. The administrator was fired on January 20th. And we‚Äôve already seen the devastation caused in air traffic. Two days later, Trump‚Äôs Treasury Department handed Musk access to the most sensitive financial data in the country.

A reminder once more that the President has zero authority to reallocate funds already appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose. And an unelected billionaire oligarch has even less than zero authority to hijack and reallocate funds.

If Musk were an elected official, this would be a massive conflict of interest. Instead, it‚Äôs something even worse: a billionaire oligarch being given unchecked power over Americans‚Äô financial information. If any other nation on Earth did this we‚Äôd consider it a coup. And that‚Äôs what this is. This is a coup. A hostile takeover. A Constitutional crisis. Meanwhile, a reminder that 16 Democrats joined Republicans to confirm the billionaire hedge fund manager Bessant, who is now handing over the keys to our $28T economy to Musk.

2. Weaponizing the Justice System: Firing FBI Officials Who Investigated the Insurrection
This attempted purge of FBI officials involved in the prosecution of January 6th insurrectionists is of the most chilling early actions of the Trump regime. A reminder that Trump pardoned 1,500 white supremacist felons convicted for their role in the violent coup attempt. The people who stormed the Capitol in tactical gear, wore ‚ÄúCamp Auschwitz shirts,‚Äù beat police officers to death, and openly called to execute public officials are now free to walk the streets, while the law enforcement officials who held them accountable are being punished for doing their jobs.

Now, the Department of Justice has ordered the termination of eight senior FBI officials and demanded a list of every agent who worked on prosecuting January 6 insurrectionists. This is a direct authoritarian attack on law enforcement officials who dared to uphold the rule of law. In response, several of my contacts in the FBI leaked the following internal updates to me:

When told they were being fired, the FBI executives refused to leave. The Agents Association advised the Administration that it was unlawful by statute. They told the Administration they are required full formal OPR [Office of Professional Responsibility] adjudication before dismissals as we are not political appointees. So the Administration threatened that ‚Äúwe will OPR you‚Äù and all executives said ‚Äúgo for it.‚Äù Bottom line no one was walked out. The Administration backed down once they were threatened with legal action. They may OPR everyone but good luck with that. This makes me feel much better. Keeping you up to date.
One of the first rules in resisting autocracy is ‚Äúdo not comply in advance.‚Äù Therefore, it is encouraging to see that the targeted FBI officials have threatened legal action, which has temporarily halted the firings. The FBI has also refused to turn over the names of agents involved in January 6th cases until the DOJ provides a legal justification. As a reminder, this is the same tactic Trump used last week when he attempted to purge 17 Inspectors General. The IGs also responded by pointing out that Trump did not follow the legal procedure to fire them, and therefore refused to leave their posts. Finally, USDA Inspector General Phyllis Fong was forced to leave. This is courage in the face of fascism.

Clearly, Trump does not support law enforcement. He only supports law enforcement when it is a tool to uphold white supremacy and silence dissent.

3. Censoring Public Health: Erasing Critical Medical Information
The Trump regime has purged crucial public health resources from government websites, an action that medical experts warn will cost lives. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has removed:

Contraception guidance

HIV prevention and treatment resources

Studies on mental health in transgender and nonbinary communities

Data on bullying, suicide rates, and drug use in marginalized communities

The Infectious Diseases Society of America has condemned these removals, stating that erasing HIV information directly undermines efforts to end the epidemic, and will lead to more death. Indeed, as we still recover from the deadly COVID pandemic, we know all too well how stripping access to health resources costs lives. This move by the Trump regime will kill people, and sadly that appears to be the point.

4. Reviving Concentration Camps: 30,000 Migrants to Be Detained at Guantanamo Bay
Trump‚Äôs Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is preparing to detain up to 30,000 migrants at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

This is not just a return to some of the darkest moments of U.S. history‚Äîit is an intentional echo of Executive Order 9066, which led to the mass internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Already we see reports of ICE illegally detaining U.S. citizens, assuming they are ‚Äúillegal‚Äù because of the color of their skin. Meanwhile DHS Secretary Noem, whom 6 Democrats joined Republicans to confirm, is on the streets with ICE assisting, even as IC raids of schools and hospitals. Yes, even children are not spared this cruelty, including sick children. For example, the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Atlanta sent a notice to its entire staff to prepare for ICE raids, and provided guidance on how to remain calm when they show up. The Trump regime wants Americans to believe that ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is targeting and arresting sick children at their most vulnerable point in life. Barbaric.

And for those who claim that ‚ÄúAmerica is becoming 1930s Germany‚Äù, let‚Äôs remember that in the 1930s, Hitler sent his lawyers to study U.S. segregation laws, ultimately to model his own genocidal policies. America was Hitler‚Äôs blueprint, and shockingly, Hitler‚Äôs lawyers reported back to him that the U.S. segregation laws were in fact ‚Äútoo extreme, even for Nazis.‚Äù (The pre-eminent book on this topic is Hitler‚Äôs American Model by Princeton Professor James Q Whitman). Trump is not ‚Äúcopying 1930s Germany,‚Äù but reviving 1920s America‚Äîthe America of Jim Crow, immigration bans, women‚Äôs oppression, and state-sanctioned racial violence.

That is what ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù has always meant.

5. Shutting Down Humanitarian Aid: USAID Purge
The Trump regime has virtually dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)‚Äîthe agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to people in crisis worldwide.

At least 56 senior USAID officials have been placed on administrative leave, while over $1 billion in critical aid has been frozen. This means:

Food assistance for starving children has been blocked

Medical aid for war-torn regions has been suspended

Disaster relief programs have been dismantled

All of this is being carried out under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom Democrats joined Republicans in unanimously confirming 99-0.

This is not just MAGA cruelty‚Äîit is bipartisan complacency.

6. Igniting a Trade War: Tariffs That Will Crush Consumers
Trump has recklessly imposed a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on all imports from China. These tariffs are scheduled to go live on Tuesday at midnight February 4 Let‚Äôs be clear: Tariffs are not paid by foreign governments or foreign companies. They are paid by American consumers. And unsurprisingly, Canada and Mexico have already announced retaliatory tariffs:

Canada is imposing 25% tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. exports

Mexico is planning tariffs on U.S. pork, cheese, fresh produce, and steel

This will skyrocket prices for consumers while crushing American businesses that rely on exports. Trump either doesn‚Äôt understand basic economics or doesn‚Äôt care how much working people suffer. At a time of historically high wealth and income inequality, this reckless move will further crush working people.

7. The Ideological Purge: Attacking DEI and Silencing Journalists
As I‚Äôve documented before, Trump is purging non-white officials, political opponents, women, and journalists from federal agencies and the Pentagon. Specifically, since taking office, he has:

Canceled student visas for pro-Palestinian protesters, a clear First Amendment violation

Ordered Politico, the New York Times, and NBC to vacate their Pentagon offices, and has replaced them with OANN, Breitbart, and the New York Post‚Äîright wing outlets with a history of bias and disinformation

Attempted to force out federal employees who are not ideologically aligned with the ‚ÄúTrump agenda‚Äù

Purged all DEIA verbiage, actions, and initiatives from all Federal agencies, and openly demonized Black and brown people, disabled people, and women as the cause of America‚Äôs problems

This is not about government reform. It is about creating a one-party fascist state where Trump controls the media, purges opposition, and rules with unchecked power.

How Do We Respond With Meaningful Action?
‚ÄúSo what do we do?‚Äù is a question I receive dozens of times per day. I answer in detail below. To be sure, the worst thing we can do is give up. Autocrats want capitulation through exhaustion and compliance through fear. Do not give them that fuel.

Instead, in response to the 7 fascist actions cited above, I offer below 7 acts we can take to enact meaningful change for justice. Even if you don‚Äôt know where to begin or don‚Äôt have expendable funds, you can play a meaningful role. Some of these action items below have immediate effect and others take time. I ask you to engage in both.

Federal Employees ‚Äî Use All Legal Means At Your Disposal: The eight FBI agent executives and the 17 Inspectors Generals refusing to comply in advance with unlawful firings are two excellent examples to follow. As federal employees, you have rights and protections. Contact employment attorneys in your area and speak to labor rights organizations. Understand your rights and know your rights. Get in good trouble, as John Lewis reminds us. Fight tooth and nail for your position, as your actions set a precedent for the future. Set the precedent of resisting autocratic terminations. Use your full constitutional protections to drag out every case imaginable and clog up the legal system for the Trump regime. If even 10% of the 2.3 million federal employees stand united and resist through the court system, you will slow down Trump autocracy. Do not capitulate to autocracy, combat autocracy with the full power of the law.

Democrats in Congress - Do Something More Than Tweet Your Outrage: Your constituents are angry, tired, and confused at your apathy, silence, and lack of organization. For your convenience, I have a short list of questions that should not be hard to answer:

Who is your party leader who should be coordinating all counter-fascism efforts and calling the shots on how to protect the American people?

Where are the daily press conferences and media blitzes documenting Trump‚Äôs fascism?

Where are the courageous protests by Members of Congress on the Capitol steps like former Congresswoman Cori Bush held in 2020 to protest the end of the rent moratorium during COVID?

Where are the Senate investigations into Trump‚Äôs corruption and Musk‚Äôs illegal access to the Treasury? How are you protecting our sensitive data?

Where are the guidances on what to do if our care is denied or the resources on getting accurate healthcare information removed from the CDC website? Where are the guidances if our SNAP, TANF, or Section 8 is denied?

Where are the barrage of lawsuits to clog up Trump‚Äôs fascist Executive Orders? For example, between lawsuits and floor votes, Republicans have attempted to repeal the ACA more than 100 times, even when in the minority, and now they might finally succeed in doing so. If Republicans can organize this effectively to strip our healthcare, why can‚Äôt you organize even half this effectively to protect our human rights?

Moreover, as Indivisible Co-Executive Director Leah Greenberg excellently said:

Democrats can oppose all Trump nominees, deny unanimous consent to slow senate proceedings, vote no on all cloture, force quorum calls at every chance. It‚Äôs a constitutional crisis. There is absolutely no reason the Senate should be connecting business as usual.

All of the above actions are wholly within Democrat control, even as the minority party‚Äîyet we see virtually none of it. Stop hiding behind the excuse of being a minority party, and start working with the awesome power of Congress afforded to you.

Everyone - Activate: Get involved in your local politics, which affects you more than most realize. Whether it is your local school board, your local city council, or your local immigrant rights organization‚Äîget involved. Show up to the next meeting, meet your local elected officials, and, for example, make sure you have a local policy on how to counter ICE raids in your local schools, shelters, and hospitals. Google is your friend in finding a local calendar of events. Use it.

Everyone - Communicate: Contact your member of Congress (find them here) and relentlessly remind them that you do not support Trump‚Äôs fascist agenda. Even if they are not willing to listen to you, inundate them with calls, texts, and emails. Ensure they hear your outrage as much as possible. Here‚Äôs a sample email to send to protest the illegal FBI firings (and illegal federal terminations in general):

Hi, my name is [insert name] and I live in [city/town/zip code]. I am a constituent of Congressman/Senators [name] and I am calling to strongly oppose the firing of any rank-and-file FBI agents, and any federal civil service employees, that are suspected to happen by the White House and DOJ. 

I am asking Congressman/Senator [name] to contact DOJ and White House leadership to demand they stop any planned action into these unjust firings and forced resignations. Unlike political appointees, line FBI agents are non-partisan federal government employees that are assigned to investigate any allegation of federal crime and they do so without any bias. Firings of these agents sets a dangerous precedent that retribution could take place if a rank-and-file FBI agent investigates a federal crime. This would fundamentally damage the core of our country‚Äôs premier law enforcement agency ‚Äî that justice is blind. In addition, the mass firings of FBI agents would also indefinitely halt thousands of cases into violent criminals and gangs, drug tracking organizations and cartels, and terrorists, which is a something that this Administration has promised to focus on.

I strongly believe civil service protections for line FBI agents help them maintain independence from external influence or pressure from any outside group, person, or political party, no matter what side. This issue is of the upmost priority for my representative to take action on this immediately and is something I will pay close attention to as the upcoming elections come around.
Everyone - Invest: Invest your time and your money into the people and organizations doing the front line work. If you have time to volunteer, make phone calls, knock doors, and sign petitions, do so. If you have the financial resources to donate to organizations working to protect our democracy, especially local orgs, please do so. Even a few dollars a month, if you can afford it, goes a long way. And as always, consider running for office yourself. And especially if you‚Äôre under 40, reach out to Run For Something to get started.

Everyone - Educate: It is critical we remain informed on the key issues, by educating ourselves and those around us. As corporate media sadly continues to capitulate to fascism, support writers and human rights lawyers working to stop fascism in America (e.g. like yours truly). Read the work of non-profit media like ProPublica, The Appeal, and more. We may not have the billions of dollars in autocrat dark money, but we have strength in numbers and your support makes that difference.

Everyone - Organize: Bring friends with you. You are the best ambassador for justice in your friend group‚Äîlead by example. Grab even one friend and drag them with you to the next school board meeting, city council session, next phone banking session to an elected official, or town hall in your local community. We need to build organizational capacity, and means each one reaches one to get involved. This also means consider joining the General Strike that so far nearly 200,000 Americans have joined. The goal is to reach 11 million Americans. You can find out more at GeneralStrikeUS.

Conclusion
The Southern Strategy never stopped. Capitulation to MAGA fascism is made possible because so many are willing to embrace culture wars to distract from economic injustices as long as it gives them the perception of racial superiority over Black and brown people. We need to reject these culture wars and recognize that billionaire oligarchs will undermine the humanity in all of us, left or right, if it makes them a few extra bucks. We need unity in this time of crisis.

The only way to fight back is through relentless resistance, organization, and action, as I‚Äôve described above. It is imperative we remember what justice looks like‚Äîbecause none of this is just‚Äîand continue to fight for that justice. I will continue to document and expose these autocratic attacks as they unfold, and I encourage you to act on the action items mentioned above. Again‚Äîdo not let legality and power be a measure of morality and justice. And finally, I need and welcome your continued support to advance my human rights advocacy.

Resist. Activate. Communicate. Invest. Educate. Organize. Subscribe. And share. Thank you for your trust in this battle for democracy itself.

Girl Scouts are encouraged to discover the needs in their own communities, which helps them understand that ‚Äúfood insecurity can be everywhere and there are a lot of ways they can be involved,‚Äù said Lindy Wood, senior education and outreach manager for Atlanta Community Food Bank.

I've been with the Atlanta Community Food Bank for five years. I recently got my start in the warehouse. Everything that's been going on these last few weeks has been devastating for a lot of people. Not just in the Augusta area, even in Arlington area about people who have gone without power and it's affected people from county to county. Since I've been here, I've seen people walk amongst with open arms. I've seen so much love. It's been a wonderful experience coming here to help the people that are in need, due to the hurricane. It's been amazing to meet different people here and their experiences, hearing how grateful they are. It's actually humble me and more ways than normal. I'm really excited to be here. Hope I get to come again. People coming and dropping off water food, perishable items for like storage and going to a self-career, a minor and going all throughout the Augusta area. I think that this is what we're doing. You know, I've been in IT for four or a few years and this is, I haven't really been able to have any but my boost on the ground.

In the wake of Hurricane Helene, we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our amazing team and network. All of our dedicated staff members have faced significant personal challenges due to this disaster, yet their unwavering commitment to helping others has been truly inspiring. 

Despite their own losses, the strength and dedication shown by our team has allowed us to serve thousands of meals a day across our 24- county service area. This would not have been possible without the tremendous support from our Feeding America network partners who have sent supplies and personnel from across the region:

- Feeding America, Feeding Georgia, Feeding the Carolinas
- Atlanta Community Food Bank
- Food Bank of Northeast Georgia 
- Georgia Mountain Food Bank
- Chattanooga Area Food Bank
- Harvest Hope Food Bank
-Middle Georgia Community Food Bank
-Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia
-Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee

Your kindness and support have made a profound difference to neighbors in crisis. We cannot thank you enough for standing with us during this challenging time. 

Together, we are making a positive impact, one meal at a time.

The Indianapolis branch of the American Red Cross announced that two volunteers drove an emergency response vehicle to North Carolina on Tuesday to provide relief for those dealing with the aftermath of the storm, which also struck five other southeastern states and caused over 120 deaths.

‚ÄúThis hurricane has caused catastrophic damage, and it extends to hundreds of miles, and has uprooted the lives of communities, and in many cases forever,‚Äù said Isis Chaverri, communications director for the Indiana Region of the American Red Cross.

The volunteers, Cindy Kvale and Dave Barker, will distribute food, water, and other critical emergency supplies to those who need them. They will join 24 other volunteers from Indiana who have already departed to help those in need.

Chaverri said that the Red Cross has now sent 60 emergency response vehicles to areas affected by the hurricane, and that four of those are from Indiana. She said that the volunteers are an important part of bringing relief to communities.

‚ÄúThe volunteers do make a big difference in providing support and comfort to thousands of people who right now, you know, have lost everything,‚Äù she said.

Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana is also providing help to those harmed by the hurricane.

The nonprofit has sent several truckloads of prebuilt disaster boxes to two of its sister food banks in Atlanta and east Tennessee. The boxes are filled with ready to eat items that the food banks will hand out to people who need them.

Gleaners said it expects to continue to support its sister food banks more in the coming weeks.

Midwest Food Bank is offering help to those in the local community affected by power outages that the hurricane caused. The organization will give out food on October 5 at Good Shepherd United Methodist Church in Indianapolis.

Midwest Food Bank has also partnered with the Salvation Army to send food and water to affected states.

The team at Masco Support Services in Georgia toured the Atlanta Community Food Bank to learn more about food insecurity and how their contribution will make a difference.

This donation helps increase access to fresh, healthy produce for families across Georgia. Each year, local farmers donate over 32 million pounds of nutritious, #2 grade produce that may not look perfect but is still perfectly nourishing. With hunger being a critical health issue‚Äîwhere 1 in 3 pantry visitors has a household member with diabetes‚Äîthis support is vital in getting fresh food to those who need it most.

Five days after a global cyber outage, it really caused a mess. Now the US Department of Transportation&#39;s Office of Aviation is stepping in and launching an investigation just hours ago. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on social media platform X that the investigation into Delta Airlines is to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions. He writes, quote, all airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly and I will make sure that right is upheld. 11 0 lives. Ariana Moniz joins us live now from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport, Ariana for days. We&#39;ve been seeing long lines, bandon luggage, piling up what are conditions like for passengers today? That&#39;s right, Chris here in Harville, we&#39;re still seeing some passengers who tell us that they&#39;ve been stranded for days at a time. And we&#39;re also seeing rows and rows of unclaimed luggage while other airlines seem to have been able to recover from Friday&#39;s cyber global outage is still appears that Delta they&#39;re still struggling to get back on track. Now I will say that the airport is not filled with as many travelers as we saw on Monday. But there are still passengers who tell us that they&#39;ve waited for days to get back home or to their destination. And that&#39;s of course due to the ongoing delays and cancellations that we still see here at heart. So now at last check, there have been 211 cancellations here at Hearts today and 203 of those flights are Delta Airlines. And that&#39;s according to and on Monday, a little under 2500 flights were canceled and under 1100 Delta flights. Now we spoke to a traveler who has been caught up in the ongoing travel disruptions. She says that she&#39;s just trying to get back home to Arizona but said she&#39;s found herself stuck here at the airport or sitting on planes going nowhere for hours. Take a listen. So I had a layover here in Atlanta and they boarded us on the plane and we sat there for three hours. Apparently, you are not allowed to sit on a plane longer than three hours. So we de boarded a couple hours later, they put us on a new plane where we sat for about 90 minutes and actually got to the tarmac, but then the pilot timed out. So we drove back to the gate, got off and about 4 a.m. they canceled our flight. So my luggage is still on that flight. So I&#39;m trying to find my way to my luggage in Reno. And that&#39;s also the story. Once passengers do arrive to their destination, some are left without their luggage and luggage is now really crowding the airport. We seeing back fill the upper level balcony and rows and rows of backs. They&#39;re lined up between Delta baggage claim carousel for passengers whose flights have been disrupted for days at a time. Yesterday, we were able to be on the upper level balcony but we have been unable to be in that area because it&#39;s now filled with bags. Now amid this ongoing investigation by the Department of Transportation, the agency secretary Pete Buttigieg, he&#39;s first encouraging passengers to try to resolve any issues that they&#39;re having first with the airline. But if they feel that Delta is not complying with the agen agency passenger protection requirements, he&#39;s encouraging passengers to then file a complaint with the Department of Transportation reporting live from Hart Jackson International Airport. I for the life back to so many people trying to reunite with luggage or families are on a thank you for more information about flight delays and cancellations. Text the word delays to the number 404885 7600.

A moment of celebration. But now the work begins when it comes to addressing a vital need in Clayton County. When we look for, where do we want to place a community food center? All the metrics show that Jonesboro was the priority. Kenny Hill is Chief supply chain Officer for the Atlanta Community Food Bank. The nonprofit opening its newest community food center in Jonesboro. This site which operates like a food pantry offers a direct line of food support to families those signing up selecting their food just like a grocery store. The center, one piece of the puzzle. Ceo Kyle Wade says when it comes to food insecurity, more than half of the people that we serve have incomes that are too high to qualify for a variety of federal benefit programs. So these are folks who are working but they just can&#39;t make ends meet. And the need across North Georgia continues to grow. The Atlanta Community Food Bank and its partners currently serve 50% more people today than they did two years ago. That&#39;s 230,000 households in Georgia, the Jonesboro Center, an extension of that support following similar pantries in Marietta and Stone Mountain. We expect this site to be one of our busiest. The demand is already pent up for this kind of resource. The hope is this direct relief will ease the burden on local families helping extend budgets overall so they can address transportation, child care. There&#39;s so many things that you have to have to be sustained as a household and we just want to help them, give them a little more margin to solve those other problems in Jonesboro, Liza Lucas 11 Alive News. Not only is there really a need here for more resources to meet the need. There&#39;s also a need for volunteers. We have all the details on how you can be a part of it or sign up for free food on 11 alive.com. Good morning.

#HungerWalk #CommunitySupport"," Sunday, March 10th, folks. It is the 40th annual Hunger Walk Run. Atlanta Food Bank annual event and it's going to be a nice one. Happy to report that to you. The sunshine is going to break back out for the latter half of the weekend. So we're looking good. We may start off with a few clouds in the morning, but other than that, we'll get that sunshine in the afternoon. 45 degrees start. The event itself starts at the Home Depot Backyard at noon. That's where registration will take place. The actual walk run takes place at two o'clock. Temperatures right at 52 degrees by noon. On our way to near 60 for an afternoon high. In fact, by the time the event ends by four o'clock will be at 58 degrees. If you're going to be hanging out talking about your time that you walk or ran 56 degrees will be our temperature by the time we hit six o'clock. It's going to be a great event. Have some fun out there folks. And don't over exert yourself a little bit. Have some fun while you're helping out our neighbors.",no longer populated,,2024-03-09T14:00:48.000Z,post data removed,,25.0,0.0,1.0,241.0,,,

Peterson speaks with the CEO of QOL Medical, Derick Cooper. They discuss how immunological systems confront pathogens and store information, the trait most associated with entrepreneurial success, the complicated patterns of behavior that scale from cellular interaction to metaphysics, and how a spirit of reciprocity can be utilized to uplift the individual as well as the community, society, and upward.

Derick Cooper is the Chief Executive Officer of QOL Medical, LLC, a large, private specialty biopharmaceutical company that makes drugs and biologics for rare diseases. QOL is a commercial stage company founded in 2003 with fully integrated capabilities ranging from sales and marketing to drug development to bioprocess-based manufacturing. Prior to 2010, Cooper spent 16 years in investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, venture capital, corporate finance, and operations with The Robinson-Humphrey Company in Atlanta, as a portfolio manager with Sirrom Capital, formerly the largest mezzanine lender in the US, and with CooperSmith, formerly the largest independent baked foods company in the US.

#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","hello everyone I'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early February and running through June Tammy and I an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the US you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information I'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas I've been working on my forthcoming book out November 2024 we who wrestle with God I'm looking forward to this I'm thrilled to be able to do it again and I'll be pleased to see all of you again soon byebye but you talked about sort of the concept of a of a a a reciprocity bank that's that's buil that's what reputation is yeah yeah that's what rep that's a good description yeah and and I think that so so if I go hunting you know it's it's 10,000 years ago and I go hunting and I'm successful and I share with with you well that now now we have mutual banking system we we have a a relationship that that transcends across time hello everyone today I have the opportunity to speak with Mr Derek Cooper dereck's the Chief Executive Officer of Q medical which is a private pharmaceutical company that specializes in the production of treatments and the origination of treatments for rare diseases so um you can understand how that properly done could be a very worthwhile Enterprise I've got to know Derek over the last few years um he volunteered to be of Aid to my Enterprise in whatever way might be useful a while back and after inves investigating his background a bit uh both Michaela my daughter and I reached out to him and we've established a very productive relationship we work together on Ralston College in Savannah Georgia and uh he's a benefactor of that institution and uh we've gone a number of adventures together in Greece with the people from Ralston College the students and and some of the other principles and benefactors and that's been extremely interesting I've i' I've had a lot of conversations with Derek about deep biological matters he's an expert in immunological function and as he's instructed me about the adaptations that the immunological system is capable of we've been able to work out a mapping of the manner in which the immunological system works to Stave off pathogens and the manner in which human thought and general behavioral adaptation progresses and that's one of the things that I wanted to share with everyone today and I think we did that quite effectively bringing the communication patterns of bees along for the ride it's very interesting you know to talk to someone whose knowledge is quite disparate from yours in some ways where where and and and still where the communication Still Remains in the boundaries of mutual comprehensibility and so I also walked Derek through his experiences as a businessman first working for a large baked Foods Enterprise and then as an investment banker we we tied that into our biological discussion as well talking about how experience can be mined to lead to what would you say the facilitation of broader and broader patterns of adaptation practically and conceptually and so that's all on the table in this discussion so welcome aboard Derek do you remember where we met and how I do um it was originally on Zoom actually I was sitting right here and uh Michaela introduced us I reached out to Michaela back when you were having some health issues um because I run a pharmaceutical company and and just have some access to resources and offered to help however I possibly could because I've over time um developed a lot of respect for what it is that you're you're doing in the world yeah well you have you have been a tremendous amount of help and so for everybody watching and listening I've worked with Derek since we've met to a large degree I suppose our most intensive collaboration has been with regards to Ralston College in Savannah and we'll talk about Ralston as we walk through this interview but dereck's also been very helpful in relation to the tour as well and has provided me with transportation and so forth when that's been and that's been extraordinarily helpful and we've also had a variety of extreme extremely productive conversations not least in Greece so I've traveled with Derek to Greece as part of her collaboration with Dr Steven Blackwood some of you watching and listening will be familiar with him as a consequence of The Exodus seminar and Dr Black Blackwood is president of Ralston college and um Derek is one of its supporters and developers and so we've traveled to Greece a number of times and gone to some remarkable places and had some amazing adventures and also had the opportunity to get to know each other at a conversational and personal level and the conversations have been extremely enlightening to me partly because Derek knows a lot of knows a lot in the biological realm especially with regard to immunological function that's something I really hope to touch on today and we found all sorts of interesting parallels between how the immune system works and how cognitive systems work and part of the reason I wanted to interview Derek today apart from the fact that he's an interesting character on the entrepreneurial side as well as the cognitive side is because of what he knows on the biological front I thought that would be really interesting to bring to people's attention so let's start if you don't mind let's start with your company do you want to describe it and describe its scale and and exactly what you do sure yeah so it's a midsize may maybe large private specialty biopharmaceutic company we make drugs for rare diseases so so we focus primarily on genetic diseases and therapies for those diseases which involve understanding the sort of genetic background for why those diseases may occur and then once you sort of capture that biological um dynamism you you investigate how you can possibly counter whatever may may be going wrong so um the scale of our company we have couple hundred employees um primarily in the US although we do have some European operations and we sort of run the gamut from the the manufacturing side we have inhouse to sales and Commercial operations as well as um clinical development Etc so we do fully integrated biopharmaceutical company so you told me at one time paradoxically that there's nothing rare about rare diseases when you take them in there in their cumulative sense so maybe you could explain to everybody what that means yeah so I think that a rare disease in the US at least is defined as a disease that less than 200,000 people have um and typically rare diseases are are rare e each Silo each disease is rare because um they tend to be fairly impactful to human health and and can cause real problems and so when they're when they are more significant in terms of human health it's they're less likely to have survived through evolutionary history so each rare disease in and of itself is unique but and and relatively small uh in terms of the prevalence or the number of people that that would have the disease but overall the total people with rare diseases if you add up all of the categories of each individual disease is pretty pretty substantial um and another thing that's happening just as we as we evolve in the industry and learn more about the genetic background of different diseases what we're learning is that they have implications for other diseases so so a rare disease that impacts COG nitive function for example we find that that maybe minor mutations with something like that could have a broader impact on a dis disease like dementia for example there there the two could be related and so then you you learn about the um disease in in a broader context by focusing on the on the sort of hyp severe portion of the right well well that's that's I suppose in some ways that's almost a scientific truism because it turns out that because everything is ultimately connected if you investigate anything deeply enough even something rare you start to find commonalities between what you're and and associations between what you're studying and all sorts of things that are relevant in the broader world one of the things you see in the careers of scientists often is that you know they start out to some degree maybe when they're undergraduates as generalists then they specialize intensely on a phenomenon that that might seem trivial because of its of its particular specificity genetic mutations and fruit flies I suppose comes to mind but as the scientist develops his or her career and starts to approach the limits of their cognitive ability the connections between what they're studying and everything else start to become more and more apparent to them and as their careers progress they become broader and broader in their range of knowledge and and I think that's a this is partly why I think it's possible for people to follow what they're interested in and to do that effectively because if you follow what you're interested in even if it's a pinpoint it'll lead you to if you do it properly and in a disciplined Manner and striving uphill it'll lead you to wherever you want to go and I guess this is partly also what happened to you I and I'm kind of interested in that on the autobiographical front because you started out in Investment Banking you were in investment banking for 16 years right so maybe walk us through that and tell tell everybody how it is that you your interests transformed across that period of time and how you ended up first of all in Investment Banking and then out of it and then into the company that you that you now run yeah so so when I left undergraduate school at at Washington and Lee I I started in what's called corporate finance and Investment Banking which is uh sort of the the capital raising side we we would help small and midsize companies uh go public or raise debt and and uh execute on an acquisition that kind of thing um and then I ended up uh moving to a um I moved to a family-owned business that my father uh had built after working for a good-sized Fortune 500 company for for many years he left in the late 80s and started his own company in the baked Foods business of all things so I I moved into the operations of a baked Foods business it was a good-sized company we had 2500 employees at one point um operations throughout the southeast um we then sold that company about 10 years later so in the late 90s I worked for that company for a while and and after we sold it I went to work for a company in in Nashville Tennessee actually which was a Mez was called a mezanine capital it's basically um helping invest in small companies so they can they can grow um at the time it was a lot of fun it was right in the uh sort of peak of the internet craze so we were chaos would be the defining characteristic of what was happening in the capital markets at the time and so we're um making a lot of investments in a lot of different small companies um and then uh that company was sold and I I sort of talked to my family and some friends and we ended up putting together a a private uh Equity investment company that ultimately made an investment in this pharmaceutical company in 2003 and then I just I was on the board initially and got to know the company and then joined the company full-time in 2010 as CEO and have been there ever since so when you started out in the baked Foods company what did you what what did you what did that teach you what did that teach you about business and what and so what did it teach you personally what did it teach you about business and what did it teach you that enabled you to make the move to the investment banking side of things and then into the pharmaceutical industry so you because the the reason I'm asking I suppose is because you have an intellectual interest that will explore in relationship to biology but you also have business knowledge and interest that enables you to not only investigate cognitively let's say and conceptually but to run a business successfully and profitably and to manage people while doing that and that's a you know that's not an obviously overlapping skill set so I'm curious to pull out the threads and to explain you know how both of those abilities developed so let's go on the business side first you started with this baked goods Bak baked Foods company yeah so I I think I think maybe it is more of an overlapping skill set because a a bank Foods company is defined by sort of a hyperco competitive environment and it's very much what I would call a cost driven business and what what I mean by that is you have to watch your cost very very carefully because the margins are thin there's a lot of competition we basically were producing a very high volume of like white bread and the the the basic stuff that you get on the Shelf in in a Walmart grocery store white bread and wheat bread and hot dog and hamburger buns and distributing them to I mean we had a facility in BD North Carolina they would make 50,000 pounds of an hour just to just to put some perspective on this so uh because of that fairly low margin cost- driven business you have to manage the hierarchy of costs really really precisely because anything that sort of grows or gets out of control can can be in terms of the the cost of the business so it's it's sort of the the extreme side of pencil sharpening um I would say I would say the pharmaceutical business by ju toos is almost the complete opposite it is driven by um a focus on the intellectual property development around a unique approach to treating a particular disease which is highly complex and uh requires an extraordinary amount of of thaning to to ju poos the two and the the consequence of that is that uh the the margins in the industry are just just completely different because the investment comes on developing the product and the and the patent portfolio around the product and that kind of thing as opposed to managing the cost explicitly but but your question's a good one it's not one I've thought about before because one of the things that we do somewhat uniquely with our company is we we manage our costs pretty rigorously even though we don't necessarily have to because because it is a more Pro profitable business than baked foods for example but what I found in in doing that is that it it limits chaos because if you if you sort of are continuously hyperfocusing on what it is that is your goal and make sure that you are um not allowing noise to enter the situation in pursuit of that goal it it well it's highly correlated with success to be to be focused and and not allow the organization to to become too chaotic in pursuit of a goal is yeah so so I'm I'm trying to think of that from a psychological and a trait perspective I mean we we know very well that success in complex Endeavors is primarily dependent on intelligence but that personality trait variance also plays a role and so when you're talking about very tight cost control I immediately think of two things and one is conscientiousness that's the ability to pay attention that's orderliness and industri the ability to and willingness and desire for that matter to pay attention to details so Details Matter and I would also suspect a certain degree of disagreeable disagreeableness too because when you're talking about control of costs let's say to me and this is partly practical experience speaking that also means the ability to say no right and control implies no right right so but then on the product development side let's say with regards to the pharmaceutical industry that seems to be more something associated with high levels of openness and creativity interest in intellectual matters and so that that's a relatively rare combination extremely high openness and I know that's characteristic of you because I've talked to you a lot and you're unbelievably interested in ideas but you're also extremely detail oriented so that's a relatively rare overlap of traits and so um it sounds to me like you really did when when you were working with the in the in the baked Foods industry did you did you enjoy the the detail management that was associated with keeping the company functional despite it being lean no no that was that was not something that I found interesting it it's it's necessary and I understood the value U from a good management perspective but but uh I do I am a bit of a chaos Seeker In from from an openness perspective I do like to explore new ideas and so an overly ordered organization is not is not Optimum for me as we head toward a presidential election in November one thing you can be sure of 2024 will be a tumultuous year how will your hard-earned savings fair you already see the impacts of inflation at the pump in the grocery store the dollar continues to lose buying power quicker than wages can increase so how are you protecting your savings consider diversifying with gold from the Birch gold group for decades gold has been the choice of investors in C central banks to hedge against inflation if you have an IRA or 401K from a previous employer that's just Gathering dust call Birch gold and they will help you convert it into an IRA in Gold you won't pay a penny out of pocket they will simply convert that 401k into physical gold which unlike digital currency can't be tampered with just text Jordan to 98 9898 and Birch gold will send you a free info kit on gold with an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau thousands of satisfied customers in the exclusive gold company of the daily wire for the past 7 years you can trust Birch gold 2 text Jordan to 9898917350 conscientious and that you have a certain degree of emotional resilience so you're low in neuroticism those are the best predictors on the managerial front on the entrepreneurial front the best predictors are intelligence once again because that's Universal across any domain that's complex but o trait openness and openness is basically aesthetic appreciation on the one hand and interest in ideas and intellectual exploration on the other and my empirical investigations into predicting entrepreneurship showed quite clearly that the major trait predictor there was openness by a substantial margin and so it sounds to me like you when you were in your baked Foods um Incarnation let's say that there was plenty of room there for conscientiousness but not necessarily as much room as you have now for the investigation into well into deep problems the intellectual investigation is that fair that's fair that's a very good description okay okay but it TR but it trained you yeah I I think that there's a um if you're a very open person it's good to work on the discipline you know if if you're if you're in a role like a CEO ultimately your responsibility is strategic you you need to be looking ahead and deciding where the organ is going and what it is that you're going to do and and how you get there and but you have to learn to constrain your own openness in terms of seeking those things because if you don't you will become the biggest source of Chaos in the organization because very open people tend to be well open to lots of different ideas and so you you if you can discipline yourself on that front first then I think that that it propagates throughout the organization ultimately and it's it's like anything you have to draw the boundary between Chaos and Order yeah yeah intelligently matter of fact I think you could even Define competence that way as the sort of optimum Dynamic um positioning of the boundy between Order and Chaos depending on the circumstances and it does change because do do you have do you have any idea how in your present business you make a decision about so okay so if you're open Any Given idea has a high probability of triggering a set of associated ideas and the more open you are the larger the Gap is between the ideas that are triggered so in fact when you're talking to highly open People they'll jump from one topic to another and if you're less open you may not understand that there's any connection between those ideas at all now the advantage to that is that you bring things together that are not normally conceptualized together and and also you're a seeker of multiple Pathways but the disadvantage as as you're inferring or even pointing out is that well if you have 40 if you have 30 open people working on a project there's going to be like 900 ideas a day and some of those might even be great ideas but the problem is is that well most great ideas are still going to fail pursuit of any great idea is unbelievably timec consuming and costly and you can't do everything at once and so how have you learned do you think to distinguish between the ideas that attract your interest that are worth pursuing and the ideas that attract your interest that are you know that you have to let fall by the wayside and you know how have you learned to deal with that conceptually but also practically right because you can have people around you that can help you with that too so how have you solved that problem given your openness yeah yeah you know that's a good question I I hadn't really thought about it before I I think that what what occurs is is a process of sort of aligning the opportunity with with the relevant sacrifice that you have to um in the in the investment world we call it good Capital allocation so so the way that you do this with Investments is you sort of create a hierarchy of your opportunities and whatever is at the top of the hierarch your very best opportunity where you can get the best return you put as much resource into that opportunity fill that bucket first before you allow um War Warren Buffett says this in an extraordinarily uh py manner he says you know when you're 25 years old down and write down the top 25 goals that you have for your life draw a line under number five tear the page off keep the top five and don't ever change and don't do anything else I mean you can make you know some changes but but it's a it's a capturing of this concept of high focus yeah and so I I think you have to uh if you have an extraordinary opportunity you're willing to direct more sacrifice to that to that opportunity as you should and so it's a it's a it's a mathematical it's a math Mathes balancing of the equation of how good is the opportunity and how much is it going to cost to pursue it right right well so so there's a number of avenues of exploration that are gerain to that observation so one is so if you talk to managers of small and large companies about what frustrates them one of the things you find very rapidly is they're frustrated by the constant necessity of having to put out fires so they're so busy dealing with like Crisis minutia that they never get a chance to strategize over the long run or even to sit down and think about what a reasonable medium to long-term strategy is and that is not productive but part of the reason is this is that the typical manager so the typical manager first of all fails the empirical estimates are that 65% of managers add negative net value to their companies right so that's a pretty damning that and that's a pretty damning statistic yeah I do think that's mostly chaos well well that's that that's so what happens to managers very frequently is that they spend the majority of their time with their worst employees and so the perverse management strategy which is well documented empirically is that you do the same thing with your employees that you do with your goals according to your description which is you figure out the people who are Stellar performers and you spend all your time with them and part of the reason is is that the payoff as a consequence of facilitating your Stellar um employees or Partners let's say is exponential and not L linear here and so also the probability that if you're dealing with problem employees that you're going to be able to do anything for them in the medium to long run is extremely low you don't have the time or the energy and they may not have the inclination I mean managers aren't clinical psychologists and their employees aren't people who are coming to them for psychological help so there's an analogy there know and the other thing yep yeah yeah I think that that's directionally part partially correct I might say it a little bit different I I I think that um you you yeah at at a high level it's it's definitely a par distribution and you want to you want to focus your time and energy on the sort of uber competent people that can get a lot of things done but you you need to build a functional organization that has a lot of different people and a lot of different roles and and you can't do that by saying well we're just going to focus on you know these two or three Superstars and and and hope everything else works out you you you have to you have to understand how the entire organization functions up and down the hierarchy and and I would say that that chaos to me if if things start going wrong in an in some element of the organization it it's you know the sort of hyper manager uh conscientiousness types that you're describing they want to just get rid of the chaos they don't want any change they don't want they don't want anything to sort of disturb the organization and I don't I don't think that's actually exactly right I I think there's more subtlety to it I think that when you know and sort of the sign of chaos to me is that the idea proliferation just kind of starts to go crazy you get all these well maybe we should do this maybe they're competing ideas they they um the the and that's a sign of I think in in the business context a sign of one of two two different things either you have not communicated the goal clearly as a leader or or you don't have the right goal and and people aren't sure what to do and and so they're they're actually doing the right thing in the sense that if you don't know what to do and what you are doing isn't working changing is a good idea now you that doesn't mean that you necessarily are changing in the right direction because you may or may not have access to or be privy to what is going on and other aspects of the organization but it's a to me it's a sign it's a smoke signal of something that you need to pay attention to and the other thing that I typically I see that that causes chaotic behavior is people have a goal the goal is relatively clear and they realize they're not going to be able to make the goal and so there's sort of a a fear or threat aspect that that's starting to occur and they feel like whatever it is that they're doing isn't working and they need to make a change in order to make sure that they're successful so both in a sense both of those reactions are correct but you you need to understand what it is that's motivating the person to sort of change direction uh so that you can either help them get to the goal or make sure that the goal is clear um and it's not I it's not necessarily just that that there's a misalignment of competence I think would which was your description I mean it could be well I well I I guess I I I'm also wondering it it it may be the case as well it's complicated when it comes to intelligence because intelligent people tend to perform better wherever they're put if it's complex but you could imagine a situation where there's a lot of different sub games in your corporate environment and they're all necessary so maybe there's a distinction let's say between sales and research so that's a good distinction the the the great people on the sales side aren't going to be the same people who are the great people on the research side absolutely so right so there's going to be there's going to be a distribution of competence by specialized bin I mean one of the things we know psychologically about specialized bins let's say for example because you might ask yourself well how do you conceptualize the different what does it mean for an occupation to be different from another occupation right because obviously nurse and Doctor are similar but probably you know doctor and and and uh and graphic artists aren't that similar and so it BS the question of what constitutes similarity and interest seems to be relevant in that regard right are empirical yeah you know I I think that um your goal is to is to run an uh any organization but well I'll focus on a pharmaceutical company if you want to run it well you absolutely need to understand people and I think that uh one of the things that you've been tremendously helpful to me with is things like the Big Five personality profile and understand myself and and I think if if you can understand what it is that you're good at and what it is that you are not good at and there there's a key component to that which I I would describe as epistemic humility you you have to know the boundary of what you know and what you don't know and and if you can fill in the gap or if you if you can understand that and fill in the Gap properly then you can the organization will function better because right right because you're you're sort of aligning different skill sets appropriately with what needs to be done so I think and you know another key component to this I would say I've learned from listening to you is that because different people perceive the world differently they there's the com you have to understand at least somewhat you have to have some concept of what their reference for because if you're a highly ordered um you know conscientious person then someone who's A Creative Marketing person you it's almost a different language in terms of how those people view the world and so you need to sort of uh you need to align the way that you communicate with the recipient of the of the communication because um I mean it literally is almost like a different language right right well and and you know we we hear a lot of squawking about diversity in the culture wars that are raging but there is relevant appreciation for diversity and real true diversity is actually diversity of temperament because we know there are five temperaments dimensions of temperament we know they're normally distributed and we know that there are different skills associated with them and and that those differences are real so we know for example if you're extroverted rather than introverted you're going to be motivated by social interaction and it's going to energize you rather than innovating you and it's highly probable especially if you're involved in sales this isn't invariable the case but it's highly likely that like sales especially sales that involve a lot of presentations are meeting a lot of people a lot of group presentations that's much more suitable for someone who's extroverted now extroverts can also be impulsive and and and in extreme in the extreme you know there's pathologies associated with every skill they can also you know that can degenerate into mania you don't get anything without a cost but it is extremely useful to know that people are actually different you know the people who are higher neuroticism they're going to be much more sensitive to threat and so you can imagine that that would be one of the things that would stop them from taking risks and that might be a very bad thing on the strictly entrepreneurial side but you might imagine too that having a few people around that who serve as canaries in the coal mine could also be extremely useful and agreeableness is particularly interesting in that regard because there are really pronounced advantages and disadvantages at the ends of the distribution so dis agreeable people they're they're much more likely to bargain hard for themselves so they're going to be formidable competitors and they're going to be super blunt and they can be blunt enough to to to be offensive

"," [‚ô™ INTRO MUSIC PLAYING [‚ô™ Hello, everyone. Today, I have the opportunity to speak with Mr. Derek Cooper. Derek's the Chief Executive Officer of QOL Medical, which is a private pharmaceutical company that specializes in the production of treatments and the origination of treatments for rare diseases. So you can understand how that property done could be very worthwhile enterprise. I got to know Derek over the last few years. He volunteered to be of aid to my enterprise in whatever way might be useful a while back. And after investigating his background a bit, both McKayla, my daughter, and I reached out to him and we've established a very productive relationship. We worked together on Ralston College in Savannah, Georgia. And he's a benefactor of that institution. And we've gone a number of adventures together in Greece with the people from Ralston College, the students, and some of the other principals and benefactors. And that's been extremely interesting. I've had a lot of conversations with Derek about deep biological matters. He's an expert in immunological function. And as he's instructed me about the adaptations that the immunological system is capable of, we've been able to work out a mapping of the manner in which the immunological system works to stave off pathogens and the manner in which human thought and general behavioral adaptation progresses. And that's one of the things that I wanted to share with everyone today. And I think we did that quite effectively, bringing the communication patterns of bees along for the ride. It's very interesting to talk to someone whose knowledge is quite disparate from yours in some ways. And still, where the communication still remains in the boundaries of mutual comprehensibility. And so I also walked Derek through his experiences as a businessman first working for large baked foods, enterprise, and then as an investment banker, we tied that into our biological discussion as well, talking about how experience can be mine to lead to what would you say, the facilitation of broader and broader patterns of adaptation, practically and conceptually. And so that's all on the table in this discussion. So welcome aboard. Derek, do you remember where we met and how? I do. It was originally on Zoom, actually, I was sitting right here. And Michaela introduced us. I reached out to Michaela back when you were having some health issues, because I run a pharmaceutical company and just have some access to resources and offered to help, however, I possibly could, because I've over time developed a lot of respect for what it is that you're doing in the world. Yeah, well, you have been a tremendous amount of help. And so for everybody watching and listening, I've worked with Derek since we've met to a large degree, I suppose our most intensive collaboration has been with regards to Ralston College in Savannah. And we'll talk about Ralston as we walk through this interview. But Derek's also been very helpful in relation to the tour as well, and has provided me with transportation and so forth. And that's been extraordinarily helpful. And we've also had a variety of extremely productive conversations, not least in Greece. So I've traveled with Derek to Greece as part of our collaboration with Dr. Steven Blackwood. Some of you watching and listening will be familiar with him as a consequence of the Exodus seminar on Dr. Blackwood, his president of Ralston College. And Derek is one of its supporters and developers. And so we've traveled to Greece a number of times and gone to some remarkable places and had some amazing adventures and also had the opportunity to get to know each other at a conversational and personal level. And the conversations have been extremely enlightening to me, partly because Derek knows a lot in the biological realm, especially with regard to immunological function. That's something I really hope to touch on today. And we've found all sorts of interesting parallels between how the immune system works and how cognitive systems work. And part of the reason I wanted to interview Derek today, apart from the fact that he's an interesting character on the entrepreneurial side, as well as the cognitive side, is because of what he knows on the biological front. I thought that would be really interesting to bring to people's attention. So let's start. If you don't mind, let's start with your company. Do you want to describe it and describe its scale and exactly what you do? Sure. Yeah. So it's a midsize, maybe large private specialty bio pharmaceutical company. We make drugs for rare diseases. So we focus primarily on genetic diseases and therapies for those diseases, which involve understanding the sort of genetic background for why those diseases may occur. And then once you capture that biological dynamism, you investigate how you can possibly counter whatever may be going wrong. So the scale of our company, we have a couple hundred employees, primarily in the US, although we do have some European operations. And we sort of run the gamut from the manufacturing side. We have in-house to sales and commercial operations, as well as clinical development, et cetera. So we do fully integrated bio pharmaceutical company. So you told me at one time paradoxically that there's nothing rare about rare diseases when you take them in their cumulative sense. So maybe you could explain to everybody what that means. Yeah. So I think that a rare disease in the US at least is defined as a disease that less than 200,000 people have. And typically rare diseases are rare. Each silo, each disease is rare because they tend to be fairly impactful to human health. And can cause real problems. And so when they are more significant in terms of human health, it's they're less likely to have survived through evolutionary history. So each rare disease in and of itself is unique, and relatively small in terms of the prevalence or the number of people that would have the disease. But overall, the total people with rare diseases, if you add up all of the categories of each individual disease, is pretty substantial. And another thing is happening just as we evolve in the industry and learn more about the genetic background of different diseases, what we're learning is that they have implications for other diseases. So a rare disease that impacts cognitive function, for example, we find that maybe minor mutations or something like that could have a broader impact on a disease like dementia, for example. The two could be related. And so then you learn about the disease in a broader context by focusing on the sort of hyper severe portion of the... Right, well, that's I suppose in some ways that's almost a scientific truism because it turns out that because everything is ultimately connected, if you investigate anything deeply enough, even something rare, you start to find commonalities between what you're... And associations between what you're studying and all sorts of things that are relevant to the broader world. One of the things you see in the careers of scientists often is that they start out to some degree, maybe when they're undergraduates, as generalists. Then they specialize intensely on a phenomenon that might seem trivial because of its particular specificity, genetic mutations and fruit flies, I suppose, comes to mind. But as the scientist develops his or her career and starts to approach the limits of their cognitive ability, the connections between what they're studying and everything else start to become more and more apparent to them and as their careers progress, they become broader and broader in their range of knowledge. And I think that's it. This is partly why I think it's possible for people to follow what they're interested in and to do that effectively because if you follow what you're interested in, even if it's a pinpoint, it'll lead you to... If you do it properly and in a disciplined manner and striving uphill, it'll lead you to wherever you wanna go. And I guess this is partly also what happened to you. And I'm kind of interested in that on the autobiographical front because you started out in investment banking, you were in investment banking for 16 years, right? So maybe walk us through that and tell everybody how it is that you, your interests, transformed across that period of time and how you ended up, first of all, in investment banking and then out of it and then into the company that you now run. So when I left undergraduates school at Washington and Lee, I started in what's called corporate finance in investment banking, which is sort of the capital raising side. We would help small and mid-sized companies go public or raise debt and execute on an acquisition, that kind of thing. And then I ended up moving to a family owned business that my father had built after working for a good size, Fortune 500 company for many years. He left in the late 80s and started his own company in the baked foods business of all things. So I moved into the operations of a baked food business. It was a good size company. We had 2500 employees at one point. Operations throughout the southeast. We didn't sold that company about 10 years later. So in the late 90s, I worked for that company for a while and after we sold it, I went to work for a company in Nashville, Tennessee, actually, which was a, it was called a Mezzanade Capital. It's basically helping invest in small companies so they can grow. At the time, it was a lot of fun. It was right in the sort of peak of the internet craze. So we were, okay, that would be the defining characteristic of what was happening in the capital markets at the time. And so we're making a lot of investments in a lot of different small companies. And then that company was sold and I sort of talked to my family and some friends and we ended up putting together a private equity investment company that ultimately made an investment in this pharmaceutical company in 2003. And then I just, I was on the board initially, and got to know the company and then joined the company full-time in 2010. The CEO had been there ever since. So when you started out in the big foods company, what did you, what did you, what did that teach you? What did that teach you about business? And what, and so what did it teach you personally? What did it teach you about business? And what did it teach you that enabled you to make the move to the investment banking side of things and then into the pharmaceutical industry? So you, because the reason I'm asking, I suppose is because you have an intellectual interest that will explore in relationship to biology, but you also have business knowledge and interest that enables you to not only investigate cognitively, let's say, and conceptually, but to run a business successfully and profitably and to manage people while doing that. And that's a, you know, that's not an obviously overlapping skill set. So I'm curious to pull out the threads and to explain, you know, how both of those abilities developed. So let's go on the business side first. You started with this big, big, big foods company. Yes, so I think maybe it is more of an overlapping skill set because a big foods company is defined by sort of a hyper competitive environment. And it's very much what I would call a cost driven business. And what I mean by that is you have to watch your costs very, very carefully, because the margins are thin. There's a lot of competition. We basically were producing a very high volume of like white bread. But the basic stuff that you get on the shelf and in a Walmart grocery store, white bread and wheat bread and hot dog and hamburger buns and distributing them to, I mean, we had a facility in Valdez, North Carolina, that would make 50,000 pounds an hour just to put some perspective on this. So because of that fairly low margin cost driven business, you have to manage the hierarchy of costs really, really precisely. Because anything that sort of grows or gets out of control can be disastrous in terms of the cost of the business. So it's sort of the extreme side of pencil sharpening. I would say the pharmaceutical business by juxtaposition is almost the complete opposite. It is driven by a focus on the intellectual property development around a unique approach to treating a particular disease, which is highly complex and requires an extraordinary amount of, of, thanking to juxtapose the two. And the consequence of that is that the margins in the industry are just completely different because the investment comes on developing the product and the patent portfolio around the product and that kind of thing as opposed to managing the costs explicitly. But your question is a good one. It's not what I've thought about before, because one of the things that we do somewhat uniquely with our company is we manage our costs pretty rigorously, even though we don't necessarily have to, because it is a more profitable business than baked foods for example. But what I've found in doing that is that it limits chaos, because if you sort of are continuously hyper focusing on what it is that is your goal and make sure that you are not allowing noise to enter the situation and pursuit of that goal, it, well, is highly correlated with success, to be focused and not allow the organization to become too chaotic and pursuit of a goal is.

Yeah, so I'm trying to think of that from a psychological and a trait perspective. I mean, we know very well that success in complex endeavors is primarily dependent on intelligence, but that personality trait variants also plays a role. And so when you're talking about very tight cost control, I immediately think of two things. And one is conscientiousness. That's the ability to pay attention. That's orderliness and industrious. The ability to and willingness and desire for that matter to pay attention to details. So details matter. And I would also suspect a certain degree of disagreeable, disagreeableness too, because when you're talking about control of costs, let's say, to me, and this is partly practical experience speaking, that also means the ability to say no. And control applies. No, right. So, but then on the product development side, let's say with regards to the pharmaceutical industry, that seems to be more something associated with high levels of openness and creativity and interest in intellectual matters. And so that's a relatively rare combination, extremely high openness. And I know that's characteristic of you, because I've talked to you a lot, and you're unbelievably interested in ideas. But you're also extremely detailed oriented. So that's a relatively rare overlap of traits. And so it sounds to me like you really did when you were working with the in the in the baked foods industry, did you did you enjoy the the detail management that was associated with keeping the company functional, despite it being lean? No, no. That was that was not something that I found interesting. It's it's necessary and I understood the value from a good management perspective. But I do I am a bit of a chaos seeker in from from an openness perspective. I do like to explore new ideas. And so an overly ordered organization is not is not optimum for me. Right. So you weren't you weren't fundamentally interested in so for everyone listening and watching. If your temperamentally suited to be a manager, let's say, what that means most basically is that you're intelligent and that you're conscientious and that you have a certain degree of emotional resilience. So you're low in your autism. Those are the best predictors on the managerial front. On the entrepreneurial front, the best predictors are intelligence once again, because that's universal across any domain that's complex. But oh, trait openness and openness is basically aesthetic appreciation on the one hand and interest in ideas and intellectual exploration on the other. And my empirical investigations into predicting entrepreneurship showed quite clearly that the major trait predictor there was openness by a substantial margin. And so it sounds to me like you when you were in your baked foods incarnation, let's say that there was plenty of room there for conscientiousness, but not necessarily as much room as you have now for the investigation into well into deep problems. The intellectual investigation. Is that fair? That's fair. That's a very good description. Okay. Okay. But it tripped, but it trained you. Yeah, I think that there's a, if you're a very open person, it's good to work on the discipline. If you're all like a CEO, ultimately your responsibility is strategic. You need to be looking ahead and deciding where the order is going and what it is that you're going to do and how you get there. But you have to learn to constrain your own openness in terms of seeing those things, because if you don't, you will become the biggest source of chaos in the organization, because very open people tend to be well open to lots of different ideas. And so you, if you can discipline yourself on that front first, then I think that it propagates throughout the organization ultimately. And it's like anything, you have to draw the boundary between chaos and order. Yeah. Yeah. Intelginally. As a matter of fact, I think you could even define confidence that way as the sort of optimum dynamic positioning of the boundary between order and chaos, depending on the circumstances. And it does change. Do you have any idea how in your present business, you make a decision about, so, okay, so if you're open, any given idea has a high probability of triggering a set of associated ideas. And the more open you are, the larger the gap is between the ideas that are triggered. So in fact, when you're talking to highly open people, they'll jump from one topic to another. And if you're less open, you may not understand that there's any connection between those ideas at all. Now, the advantage to that is that you bring things together that are not normally conceptualized together. And also you're a seeker of multiple pathways. But the disadvantage as you're inferring or even pointing out is that, well, if you have 40, if you have 30 open people working on a project, there's going to be like 900 ideas a day. And some of those might even be great ideas. But the problem is is that, well, most great ideas are still going to fail pursuit of any great ideas, unbelievably time consuming and costly. And you can't do everything at once. And so how have you learned, do you think, to distinguish between the ideas that attract your interest that are worth pursuing and the ideas that attract your interest that are, you know, that you have to let fall by the wayside. And, you know, how have you learned to deal with that conceptually, but also practically, right? Because you can have people around you that can help you with that too. So how have you solved that problem given your openness? Yeah, yeah, you know, that's a good question. I hadn't really thought about it before. I think that what occurs is is a process of sort of aligning the opportunity with with the relevant sacrifice that you have to, in the investment world, we call it good capital allocation. So the way that you do this with investments is you sort of create a hierarchy of your opportunities. And whatever is at the top of the hierarchy, you're very best opportunity where you can get the best return. You put as much resource into that opportunity, fill that bucket first. Before you allow, Warren Buffett actually says this in an extraordinarily pithy manner. He says, you know, when you're 25 years old, down and right down the top $25 that you have for your life, draw a line under number five, tear the page off, keep the top five and don't ever change and don't do anything else. I mean, you can make some changes, but it's a capturing of this concept of high-prepocus. I think you have to, if you have an extraordinary opportunity, you're willing to direct more sacrifice to that opportunity as you should. And so it's a mathematical, it's a mass-ass balancing of the equation of how good is the opportunity and how much is it going to cost to pursue it. Right. Right. Well, so there's a number of avenues of exploration that are germane to that observation. So one is, so if you talk to managers of small and large companies about what frustrates them, one of the things you find very rapidly is they're frustrated by the constant necessity of having to put out fires. So they're so busy dealing with like crisis minutia that they never get a chance to strategize over the long run or even to sit down and think about what a reasonable medium to long-term strategy is and that is not productive. But part of the reason is this is that the typical manager, so the typical manager, first of all, fails. The empirical estimates are that 65% of managers add negative net value to their companies. Right. So that's a pretty damning statistic. Yeah. Do you think that's mostly chaos? Well, well, well, that's that's that's so what happens to managers very frequently is that they spend the majority of their time with their worst employees. And so the perverse management strategy, which is well documented empirically, is that you do the same thing with your employees that you do with your goals according to your description, which is you figure out the people who are stellar performers and you spend all your time with them. And part of the reason is that the payoff as a consequence of facilitating your stellar employees or partners, let's say, is exponential and not linear. And so also the probability that if you're dealing with problem employees that you're going to be able to do anything for them in the medium to long run is extremely low. You don't have the time or the energy and they may not have the inclination. I mean, managers aren't clinical psychologists and their employees aren't people who are coming to them for psychological help. So there's an analogy there, you know, and the other thing I think, yep. Yeah. I think that that's directionally partially correct. I might say it a little bit different. I think that you do, yeah, at a high level, it's definitely a parado distributional. And you want to focus your time and energy on this sort of Uber competent people that can get a lot of things done. But you need to build a functional organization that has a lot of different people and a lot of different roles. And you can't do that by saying, well, we're just going to focus on these two or three superstars and hope everything else works out. You have to understand how the entire organization functions up and down the hierarchy. And I would say that the chaos to me, if things are going wrong and in some element of the organization, it's the sort of hyper-manager of conscientiousness types that you're describing. They want to just get rid of the chaos. They don't want any change. They don't want anything to sort of disturb the organization. And I don't think that's actually exactly right. I think there's more subtlety to it. I think that when, you know, and sort of the sign of chaos to me is that the idea proliferation just kind of starts to go crazy. You get all these, well, maybe we should do this. They're competing ideas. That's a sign of, I think, in the business context, a sign of one of two different things. Either you have not communicated the goal clearly as a leader or you don't have the right goal and people aren't sure what to do. And so they're actually doing the right thing in the sense that if you don't know what to do and what you are doing isn't working, changing is a good idea. Now, that doesn't mean that you necessarily are changing in the right direction because you may or may not have access to or be privy to what is going on in other aspects of the organization. But to me, it's a sign. It's a smoke signal of something that you need to pay attention to. And the other thing that I typically I see that the causes chaotic behavior is people have a goal. The goal is relatively clear and they realize they're not going to be able to make the goal. And so there's sort of a fear or threat aspect that's starting to occur. And they feel like whatever it is that they're doing isn't working. And they need to make a change in order to make sure that they're successful. So both in a sense, both of those reactions are correct that you need to understand what it is that's motivating the person to sort of change direction so that you can either help them get to the goal or make sure that the goal is clear. And it's not necessarily just that there's a misalignment of confidence, I think, would you? Which was your description? I mean, it could be. Well, I guess I'm also wondering it may be the case as well. It's complicated when it comes to intelligence because intelligent people tend to perform better wherever they're put if it's complex. But you could imagine a situation where there's a lot of different sub-games in your corporate environment. And they're all necessary. So maybe there's a distinction, let's say, between sales and research. So that's a good distinction. The great people on the sales side aren't going to be the same people who are the great people on the research side. Absolutely. So there's going to be a distribution of confidence by specialized bin. I mean, one of the things we know psychologically about specialized bins, let's say, for example, because you might ask yourself, well, how do you conceptualize the different? What does it mean for an occupation to be different from another occupation? Right? Because obviously, nursing doctors are similar, but probably, you know, doctor and graphic artists aren't that similar. And so it begs the question of what constitutes similarity and interest seems to be relevant now, regard, right? We're experiencing a lot of global instability as we plunge into primary season. How are you protecting your family in the midst of all this chaos? The fact is, there is one asset that has was stood famine, moors, and political and economic upheaval dating back to biblical times.

Yeah, you know, I think that gold is to run any organization, but well, I'll focus on a pharmaceutical company. If you want to run it well, you absolutely need to understand people. And I think that one of the things that you've been tremendously helpful to me with is things like the Big Five Personality Profile, and I understand myself. And I think if you can understand what it is that you're good at and what it is that you are not good at, and there's a key component to that, which I would describe as epistemic humility. You have to know the boundary of what you know and what you don't know. And if you can fill in the gap, or if you can understand that and fill in the gap properly, then the organization will function better because you're sort of aligning different skill sets appropriately with what needs to be done. So I think, and another key component to this, I would say I've learned from listening to you, is that because different people perceive the world differently. You have to understand at least somewhat, you have to have some concept of what their reference for. Because if you're a highly ordered conscientious person, then someone who's a creative marketing person, it's almost a different language in terms of how those people view the world. And so you need to sort of, you need to align the way that you communicate with the recipient of the communication, because I mean, it literally is almost like a different language. Right, right. Well, and you know, we hear a lot of squawking about diversity in the culture words that are raging, but there is relevant appreciation for diversity. And real true diversity is actually diversity of temperament, because we know there are five temperaments, dimensions of temperament. We know they're normally distributed, and we know that there are different skills associated with them and that those differences are real. So we know, for example, if you're extroverted, rather than introverted, you're going to be motivated by social interaction. And it's going to energize you rather than innovating you. And it's highly probable, especially if you're involved in sales. This isn't invariably the case, but it's highly likely that like sales, especially sales that involve a lot of presentations, a meeting a lot of people, a lot of group presentations that's much more suitable for someone who's extroverted. Now extroverts can also be impulsive. And and in extreme, in the extreme, you know, there's pathologies associated with every skill, they can also, you know, that can degenerate into mania. You don't get anything without a cost, but it is extremely useful to know that people are actually different, you know, the people who are higher neuroticism, they're going to be much more sensitive to threat. And so you can imagine that that would be one of the things that would stop them from taking risks. And that might be a very bad thing on the strictly entrepreneurial side, but you might imagine too that having a few people around that who serve as canaries in the coal mine could also be extremely useful. And agreeableness is particularly interesting in that regard, because there are really pronounced advantages and disadvantages at the ends of the distribution. So disagreeable people, they're, they're much more likely to bargain hard for themselves. So they're going to be formidable competitors. And they're going to be super blunt. And they can be blunt enough to, to, to be offensive, especially if you're agreeable and neurotic. But they'll tell you exactly what the hell's going on. And if you need a foil for yourself and also someone who if allied with you can help you stop you from being taken advantage of. They're unbelievably useful. Whereas agreeable people, they can be taken advantage of but they're very good at facilitating social bonds between people and making the environment have that feeling of what what closeness and intimacy. Now that's not always appropriate, but sometimes it's unbelievably useful. Right. And so yeah. People will tell you what they really think.

So the Thanksgiving dish which is put on by the Atlanta Community Food Bank is now 25 years old. Yeah, that&#39;s right. So it brings in members of Atlanta&#39;s local news community, like our very own crash Clark to volunteer and help feed families in need this holiday season. And this year, the Food bank showcased their brand new location in Marietta. Take a look. This place looks like a regular grocery store, but it&#39;s actually an amazing new concept from the Atlanta Community Food Bank. And it&#39;s allowing us to get more food out into the community in places where there&#39;s a lot of need and also to develop new ways to serve people so that we&#39;re having a bigger impact every week. About 600 families in need who qualify, come here and shop for groceries, just like everyone else with families receiving about ¬£100 of food per week. You&#39;re really Dorothy from Kansas. I am really Dorothy from Kansas. Dorothy who yes is originally from Kansas, but now living in Powder Springs can click her heels and receive enough groceries to feed her family every month. Now, Dorothy, I noticed you before when we were inside, you were doing some shimmying while you were doing some shopping. That&#39;s, that&#39;s because I&#39;ve been blessed because this is a blessing thing for me. I could come for, you know, every two weeks and get what I need to make my meals and stuff. I help Dorothy fill her car full of groceries and she&#39;s not alone in her praise for this new concept where those in need are treated like everyone else. And then I can get good food, good food. That&#39;s not inspired. I can meet friendly people and I get to come twice a month. This means everything to me. This year, the Atlanta Community Food Bank is celebrating one billion with a B meals given away in Metro Atlanta. They started out only giving away ¬£15,000 of food their first year, but now they give away half a million pounds of food every day. It&#39;s demonstrates how the community can really come together. Uh invest in a cause uh and work together to really help solve an issue for our community. All right. So you know, hosting family or friends for Thanksgiving, it can get expensive. So we&#39;re gonna give you a few ways that you can save some money as you plan for Turkey Day first. Create a budget and stick to it two scale back on your menu, maybe leave out some of those sides that aren&#39;t such a hit every year. Three if you want to go potluck style, have everyone chip in and bring a side or a dessert. And fourth buying in bulk that can be cheaper. And you can also shop around for the best deals and finally ditch that premade and pre cut food. Just buy the fruits and veggies yourself and then cut them up that can be cheaper.

Human rights is the core of our work. We advocate for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander (#AANHPI) and Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South Asian (#AMEMSA) communities. We work in solidarity with immigrant and refugee families, and many of our communities bear the scars of violence and share legacies of military occupation, colonization, forced displacement, and struggles for sovereignty. The widespread violence we witness today ‚Äì from Syria to Venezuela, from Myanmar to China ‚Äì is a driving force behind much of the migration and displacement we see. We cannot encapsulate the full extent of the crises that face humanity around the world. Yet, the ongoing situation in Gaza stands out as a stark #humanitarian #crisis. We condemn the bombing of densely populated regions inhabited by over 2 million people, many of whom are children. Denying essential resources like food, water, and medical aid to Gaza breaches #international #law. And we are seeing the #Palestinian people, already refugees, facing further and perhaps irrevocable displacement. As a leading Asian-American civil rights organization, our dedication lies in safeguarding the rights of our communities. We mourn the tragic loss of #Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy in Chicago, whose life was taken by blind hatred. We actively bear witness to unwarranted aggression towards peaceful demonstrators. We elevate and stand by students and individuals penalized for showcasing their solidarity with the Palestinians. The debilitating cycle of global conflicts resulting in increased #assaults, #harassment, #discrimination, #surveillance, #profiling, and #censorship against Asian-Americans is all too familiar to us. Our plea is straightforward: First, we call on the U.S. government to use their resources towards fostering communities, not devastation. Second, we urgently call on the Biden Administration to fight for and enforce an immediate ceasefire, paving the way for enduring and constructive peace. We encourage you to explore the resources from local organizations like CAIR-GA, the Georgia Muslim Voter Project, and Project South.

The legendary H BC U recently celebrated its homecoming with new students and alumni coming together to celebrate this new era of the school. Now, Morris Brown sat as a shell of itself for two decades after losing its accreditation back in 2002. Well 11 alive went one on one with the school&#39;s new president. That&#39;s Doctor Kevin James about the school&#39;s comeback and what the future holds for this institution you came in in 2022 years later, you all received accreditation. How&#39;d you do it? Well, the first thing that I had to do was I had to get people to believe it&#39;s been 20 years. No schools ever done that. They filed $35 million bankruptcy. They lost their land, they lost everything. Why are you wasting your time? So my biggest challenge in the beginning was just getting people to believe that this was possible. How did I do that? Social media? And you can hear so much more from Doctor James and a Morris Brown student who says the school is continuing a family, family legacy. You can find their story right now. On 11 alive dot com. And I gotta say, uh a big shout out to Mike Nichols, this was his vision. He&#39;s a photojournalist here. He really crafted and helped to edit that story and make it what it is. He&#39;s also at H BC U. Yeah. And I saw the Morris Brown share your story on their platforms as well. There&#39;s a lot of pride in that institution growing up here in Atlanta. A lot of people were really proud to say they went to Morris Brown and hopefully they&#39;ll continue to be able to do that as well. And I will say I did go and rent Drum Line to watch it again. 20 years later, it came out in 2002. I think that&#39;s the last time I saw it, Morris Brown of course, was featured in Drumline.

#debraforgeorgia #georgia #politics #alpharetta #atlanta #roswellga #miltonga #teachers #education"," day in the life of a political candidate with five kids. My husband took over the main duties of getting our five kids off to school this morning because I was out the door early, heading down to Atlanta for a breakfast with a state senator. I've done a lot of these meetings over the past year, both to learn what it's like to be a legislator and run for office, get advice, and also get to new folks and eventually maybe get an endorsement and it worked out well that day. So then I did some thank you notes in my car that went to lunch with a potential donor. I did not film any of that, went home, did emails, went to an SGC meeting at my school, did the afternoon shuffle, took some of my kids to soccer practice, then I got home, started dinner, and thought about how too many Georgia students don't perform well in school because they're hungry.

Which interpretation is accurate? Or is there another interpretation altogether? The only way to find out is to decode who or what is behind the creation of the Guide Stones themselves. No question, whoever built the Georgia Guide Stones What Is Climate Change?
Yes Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun‚Äôs activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
Thanks for writing us. This Video is about both side of the issues... So see the note below thanks... We did not sell out anything. We think right now... We are in a ice age time today. The Mercator's map from 1595 showing the Arctic continent with city or town and farming too. Hyperborea was usually described as and was a fabulous realm of eternal spring located in the far north beyond the home of the north wind. Its people were a blessed, long-lived race untouched by war, hard toil and the ravages of old age and disease.
Hyperborea main river was the Eridanos whose banks were lined with amber-weeping poplar-trees and its waters home to flocks of white swans. Blessed with eternal spring, the land producing two crops of grain per year, but most of the countryside was wild and covered with beautiful forests--the so-called ""garden of Apollon.""
Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun‚Äôs heat and raising temperatures.
The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.
Humans are responsible for global warmingClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.
The average temperature of the Earth‚Äôs surface is now about 1.1¬∞C warmer than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.
Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.
The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
People are experiencing climate change in diverse waysClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of ‚Äúclimate refugees‚Äù is expected to rise.
Future pandemics will continue to be a threat, so it is important to lay bare the true cause of this devastation. From the beginning, the origins of the pandemic have been debated, even though a natural zoonotic transfer to humans has been determined as the likely cause; however, speculation around a viral bioweapon and laboratory leaks remains. The evidence for the origins of this current pandemic can be found in the science and history behind biological outbreaks and the signs of bioweapon use. This knowledge will help minimize the harm of future pandemics.
One microbe has just devastated our world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, has shattered economies, upended patterns of life globally, and already killed >18.6 million people. More than 886 million cases were documented worldwide so far. Drop in U.S. birth rates amid Covid-19 could have lasting economic impact today.
Genocide Black Abortions in America Abortion kills 1,000 black babies every day in America. Abortion is not just a woman‚Äôs issue. It‚Äôs a human rights issue. Abortion is the number one killer of black lives in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, abortion kills more black people than HIV, homicide, diabetes, accident, cancer, and heart disease ‚Ä¶ combined.
In 2019, black women had 38.4% of all abortions in the U.S., despite African-Americans comprising only 13.4% of the total population.
Every increase in global warming mattersIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5¬∞C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 2.8¬∞C temperature rise by the end of the century.
The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others.The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.
We face a huge challenge but already know many solutionsMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.
Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5¬∞C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: over two-thirds of today‚Äôs proven reserves of fossil fuels need to be kept in the ground by 2050 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.
Adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.
We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the futureClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.
Despite the scientific evidence that climate change is a hoax or is not a hoax, there are many non-believers and skeptics in politics, industry, and the general population. Many climate change scientists believe that current climate models do not accurately portray the atmosphere-ocean system, and measurements made by means of satellites show no global warming but a cooling of 0.13¬∞C between 1979 and 1994. The theory of global warming assumes maximum warming at the poles, so why have average temperatures in the Arctic dropped by 0.88¬∞C over the past 50 years? The human-induced climate change hoax is a trojan horse through which unelected globalist bodies such as the United Nations are attempting to seize totalitarian control over every minute detail of our lives under the pretext of ‚Äúsaving the planet‚Äù. A report from the United Nations on climate change is based on faulty hypotheses and qualitative conclusions, not the facts about the Earth's temperature or the impact of man-made pollution on the climate. Some Americans are skeptical of whether climate change is happening at all, with the two most skeptical interviewees saying that climate change is a hoax used only for political gains.
The Vikings first colonized Greenland in A.D. 985 and made a living primarily as dairy farmers for more than 400 years before abandoning the settlements. Viking Age Greenlandic society was anchored in the many farms that dotted the settlements, with Christianity visibly present in the churches accompanying them. These farms directly exported precious goods such as skins, hides, and walrus ivory abroad while importing luxuries as well as the necessary iron. The economy of the Norse Greenlanders depended on a combination of pastoral farming with hunting and some fishing. Farmers kept cattle, sheep, and goats - shipped into the island - for their milk, cheese, and butter, while most of the consumed meat came from hunted caribou and seals. Archaeologists now suspect that the Vikings first traveled to Greenland not in search of new land to farm but to acquire walrus-tusk ivory, one of medieval Europe‚Äôs most valuable trade items.
When climate scientists talk about natural climate swings that came before humans started messing with the system, many invoke two epochs. During the Medieval Warm Period, roughly from 800 to 1200 AD, temperatures rose a few degrees above average. That warming has been connected to improved crop yields in parts of Europe, and the temporary Viking occupation of Greenland. During the following Little Ice Age, which lasted roughly from 1300 to 1850, the Greenland Vikings disappeared, glaciers from California to the European Alps advanced, and New York harbor froze, enabling people to walk from Manhattan to New Jersey without benefit of the George Washington Bridge.
For a long time, many took on faith the idea that these phenomena were global. But that assumption has been undermined in the past decade or so by studies from widespread areas (including parts of Greenland) suggesting that in fact temperatures in many places did not line up with one or the other periods. Some regions appear to have been warming when they were supposed to be cooling, and vice versa. The same goes for two lesser-known, more vaguely defined earlier swings, known as the Roman Warm Period (ca. 100-300 AD) and the Dark Ages Cold Period (ca.400-800).
A new study puts together the evidence on a global scale for the first time. Based on this, the authors say that the supposed warm and cold epochs may represent, more than anything, regional variations that can be explained by random variability. Published in the leading journal Nature this week, the study analyzes paleoclimate data from across the world, using multiple statistical methods and many sources: tree rings, glacial ice cores, corals, lake sediments. It does not suggest that the periods of high or low temperatures observed during the named epochs did not exist in certain places; rather that they did not exist everywhere at the same time, and thus probably were not caused by some kind of planetary driver.
That said, the study does find one very coherent period: an unprecedented warm one extending over 98 percent of the globe, starting in the 20th century. This is almost certainly caused by us.
We spoke with coauthor Nathan Steiger of Columbia University‚Äôs Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory about climates of the past and present, and what we can learn from them.
What are the most important conclusions of your study?
We show that previously named climate epochs of the Common Era were not coherent phenomena across the globe. This goes against the widespread notion that periods like the Little Ice Age or Medieval Warm Period were global periods of cold or warmth. We‚Äôre not the first to point out that there are problems with this idea, but our study is the first to rigorously test the hypothesis on a global scale. In contrast to this, we see that current global warming is remarkably coherent.
How do you tell what temperatures were doing in various parts of the world during these past times?
We rely on proxies. Trees, for example, can be very sensitive to annual changes in temperature and moisture, and the width and density of their annual rings reflect those year-to-year changes. We can then sample hundreds of trees all over the world along with other natural archives to infer what climate was like in the past. For this study in particular we used several different statistical methods that combine all of these proxies to produce global maps of temperature change going back 2,000 years.
Have scientists been too narrow-minded in their geographical focus? I mean, the very name ‚ÄúMedieval‚Äù calls up part of European history‚Äìa period that didn‚Äôt exist in Asia, the Americas or Africa.
Paleoclimate is like many fields of study. There are historical biases in where data is collected, and how the stories about the data are developed. The first paleoclimate data were largely collected from Europe by Europeans, and so it‚Äôs not terribly surprising that the stories that try to make sense of such data are Euro-focused. Another problem is that until recently, people have been reluctant to share data and to create narratives that include more than a single, or perhaps a few, time series. If you‚Äôre a scientist who has spent a lot of time and money in producing a particular proxy time series, then there‚Äôs a tendency to emphasize the importance of that particular time series and to develop a story explaining it. The simplest story to develop is one that corresponds to a traditional understanding of what the climate ‚Äúshould‚Äù be doing going back in time. It‚Äôs only been in the past few years that scientists from across the paleoclimate community have begun to publicly collate a wide range of data types from all over the globe.
Are you recommending that scientists stop using terms like the ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age‚Äù?
Not necessarily. In general, having simplified conceptual models of natural phenomena can be very useful and even essential in the pursuit of scientific understanding. It‚Äôs when the conceptual models get in the way of accurate science that problems arise. For example, when one labels any Common Era proxy time series with terms like the ‚ÄúMedieval Climate Anomaly,‚Äù they are usually implicitly assuming that such epochs were global, and over well-defined time intervals. Our results show that both of these assumptions are incorrect.
Not that there isn‚Äôt already plenty of evidence, but does this study add to the argument that humans are causing global warming?
We show that conditions during medieval times or during the Little Ice Age are expected to occur naturally. But the large spatial consistency of the present warm phase cannot be explained by natural variability. This result corroborates many existing studies that have shown that humans are causing global temperatures to rise since the beginning of the industrial period.
Are there limitations to your study?
Yes. Paleoclimate proxies can be used to infer past temperatures, but are not thermometers per se, and so they include non-temperature ‚Äúnoise.‚Äù We have therefore tried to use as many proxies as feasible for our study, but we are limited by where the data exists and the quality of the data. Uncertainties are usually largest in places without good quality proxy data. But for the particular hypothesis we‚Äôre testing, we don‚Äôt think these uncertainties significantly impact the results. We find the same results regardless of which proxy networks or which statistical methodologies we use. So we‚Äôre pretty confident in the results.
Georgia Guide Stones America‚Äôs Stonehenge Are they a monument to human civilization, or a powerful condemnation of our species? And who the heck built them?
What if I told you that America has its own Stonehenge?
These giant stones were set up on a hillside outside, of all places, Atlanta in 1980. The man who had them built remains unknown, as does the monument‚Äôs true purpose. In fact, other than their half-million-dollar price tag, almost nothing is known about the stones at all. They‚Äôre composed of 119 tons of solid granite and have coded messages that are engraved into them in the world‚Äôs eight most commonly spoken languages.
These rectangular pillars are also precisely crafted to track astrological and solar cycles. There are some who interpret the messages here as a sign of the end of days. Others theorize that they‚Äôre a call for genocide on a massive scale. So what‚Äôs the message they contain? Who built them? Why are they located on a remote hillside in Georgia? And, of course, what are they intended to guide us toward?
How and why the Guidestones were built have never been answered. But here‚Äôs what we do know: The monument didn‚Äôt just appear out of nowhere.
On a summer day in 1979, a man using the alias R. C. Christian shows up at the Elberton Granite Finishing Company, presents very detailed and specific plans, and tells them he wants to build the Georgia Guidestones. The only details we have about the man is that he was balding, with a fringe of white hair, and had an accent that suggested he was from one of the Plains states. Also, he had money‚Äîa lot of money. And the only thing he absolutely demanded was that he remain completely anonymous. To this day, no one has been able to figure out who he is.
What Christian commissioned, though, was no small undertaking. In fact, even with as deep a history of working with granite as Elberton had, they‚Äôd never encountered anything like the request from ‚ÄúR. C. Christian.‚Äù
In fact, even if there was nothing more to the Georgia Guidestones than the stones themselves, the monument would be exceptionally impressive‚Äîa testament to the skills and abilities of the granite company R. C. Christian hired.
But there is more to the Guidestones than the granite slabs. Much more. Some say it‚Äôs mysterious, others say it‚Äôs sinister.
The stones were unveiled during a public ceremony in 1980. They were controversial immediately. Supporters like Yoko Ono praised their message as a stirring call to rational thinking. But opponents attacked them, calling them the Ten Commandments of the Antichrist.
So what‚Äôre the messages on the stones? First, you need to know that each message appears in English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian‚Äîthe eight most widely spoken languages on Earth‚Äîwhich means the ten lines on each slab are intended for all of the world‚Äôs inhabitants.
But as for the messages themselves, the first nine, reading up from the bottom, seem to be a benign call to higher thinking: Don‚Äôt be a cancer on the earth; seek harmony; balance personal rights with social duties; avoid petty laws; resolve international conflicts in a world court; protect people with fair laws; rule with reason; unite humanity with a new language; and guide reproduction wisely. But it‚Äôs the topmost directive on the stones that stops everyone cold:
Maintain Humanity Under 500 Million In Perpetual Balance With Nature.
Here is what is written on the Georgia Guidestones:
1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
2. Guide reproduction wisely ‚Äî improving fitness and diversity.
3. Unite humanity with a living new language.
4. Rule passion ‚Äî faith ‚Äî tradition ‚Äî and all things with tempered reason.
5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
8. Balance personal rights with social duties.
9. Prize truth ‚Äî beauty ‚Äî love ‚Äî seeking harmony with the infinite.
10. Be not a cancer on the earth ‚Äî Leave room for nature ‚Äî Leave room for nature.
A human population under 500 million would certainly be more ‚Äúin balance‚Äù with nature.
But To achieve a population under 500 million would mean that more than 7 billion of us would have to die. Or be killed.
Exactly. The directive makes some believe that the Guidestones are calling for the mass murder of billions of innocent people‚Äîa global genocide that would kill the vast majority of the human race.
Which interpretation is accurate? Or is there another interpretation altogether?
The only way to find out is to decode who‚Äîor what‚Äîis behind the creation of the Guidestones themselves.
No question, whoever built the Georgia Guidestones, they were determined to protect their anonymity. So to find out more about the mysterious R. C. Christian, we began by talking to Guidestone historian Raymond Wiley, coauthor of The Georgia Guidestones: America‚Äôs Most Mysterious Monument. According to Wiley, the pseudonym R. C. Christian is a clue itself‚Äîa fairly blatant one‚Äîthat hearkens back to a 15-century physician and mystic named Christian Rosenkreutz, the idea of the Rose Cross, and the secretive organization known as the Rosicrucians.
Christian Rosenkreutz is said to have founded the secretive Rosicrucian Society in Germany in the early 15th century, but some dispute that the man even lived at all. Some people say he‚Äôs not even real. Others say he‚Äôs more than one person.
For the members of the society, Rosenkreutz was a doctor who had spent a lifetime gathering what he called sacred knowledge. Studying ancient Turkish, Sufi, and Persian paths toward understanding, as well as Western medical knowledge, he supposedly traveled through the Middle East, being instructed by masters of ancient wisdom.
When he returned, Rosenkreutz supposedly founded his own church to pass on the learning to make sure that it didn‚Äôt die with him. So, at first, all the members were doctors. Each one took an oath to heal the sick without payment, to maintain the secrecy of the fellowship, and to find a replacement for Rosenkreutz before he died.
The sacred knowledge is said to include elements of alchemy and psychic manipulation. Yup. Modern Rosicrucians are believed to have even been able to tap the ultimate power of the human mind. Some think the sect has evolved and they now seek to protect and guide humanity away from its own destruction. Others have accused the Rosicrucians of being out-and-out evil. To be clear, there are offshoots of Rosicrucians everywhere.
Think about this‚Äîif you had a vision of an American Stonehenge, a massive granite creation bearing your philosophy for the world, and you possessed the resources to underwrite its creation, would you want to keep your name out of it? For most of us, I think the answer would be ‚Äúprobably not.‚Äù Our egos and our vanity might insist that we take at least some of the credit. Yet among the inscriptions on the monument is the announcement that their byline is a pseudonym. Is this humility‚Äîor deliberate misdirection?
Human nature and the role vanity plays in it would seem to rule out one name often mentioned as a possible source of funding for the Guidestones: Ted Turner, media mogul and one of America‚Äôs largest individual owners of real estate. At one point, Turner argued that the earth would be better served by a far smaller population than our present numbers, a statement that generated much controversy at the time. But while the ideas expressed on the stones, if interpreted benignly, do reflect Turner‚Äôs well-known global harmony and environmental concerns, modesty, humility, and anonymity are not qualities often‚Äîor maybe ever‚Äî associated with the man once widely referred to as the ‚ÄúMouth of the South.‚Äù
So if the man behind the Georgia Guidestones wasn‚Äôt Turner or, probably, any other high-profile, well-heeled philanthropist or visionary, who was he?
Only a few people ever met him. One was attorney Wyatt Martin, who handled the legal matters related to the Guidestones, and who signed a vow never to discuss his client, a vow he has kept.
Another was Hudson Cone, who was present at the granite company when the Guidestones were being created. Cone remembers Christian as a tall, balding man, with a fringe of white hair. He was well spoken and comported himself well. He gave no indication of who‚Äîor what‚Äîhe represented.
That ambiguity, Cone believes to this day, was deliberate.
‚ÄúAny time you have something with an air of mystery around it,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou invite different interpretations.‚Äù
Those differing interpretations, Cone insists, are one of the things that have kept the Georgia Guidestones at the center of so much speculation and public interest. He has had people tell him that the site is the holiest spot, while others argue that it‚Äôs a profane location, a focal point for satanic power and ultimate evil.
Cone doesn‚Äôt believe that the spot or the Guidestones are evil. In fact, he thinks that the questions the Guidestones raise are themselves its truest purpose.
‚ÄúI believe it was put here to stimulate curiosity,‚Äù Cone said.
That, too, makes a lot of sense to me. What better way to get people talking‚Äîand thinking ‚Äîabout the nature of our relationship to the world and to one another‚Äîthan by creating an enormous mystery . . . and presenting that mystery in the world‚Äôs great languages so that all can participate in the discussion?
One question that has remained throughout our investigation of the Georgia Guidestones‚Äîwhy Georgia? Why were the stones placed on their particular site?
Turns out there‚Äôs a serious‚Äîand mysterious‚Äîreason for that as well.
The theory of Earth Changes, first propounded by the mystic Edgar Cayce early in the 20th century, argues that we are rapidly approaching a time of devastating changes to the surface of the earth. Those changes could be the result of earthquakes, asteroid or comet impact, super volcanoes, solar flares‚Äîwhatever. As we‚Äôve seen, particularly in terms of the 2012 believers‚Äîbut also as with previous apocalypse believers such as those who feared the end of the world would accompany the new millennium, or those who saw global devastation coming as Halley‚Äôs Comet returned, or any of the hundreds of other doomsday faiths that have come and gone‚Äîthe specific details of the actual apocalypse vary from believer to believer, and some of them have already been proven inaccurate.
What matters for the purposes of decoding the Guidestones is the consequences of the devastation.
And those consequences include a radically altered surface of the earth‚Äîa surface that will lack many of the most familiar features of the world we know.
What sort of features?
Minor things like: California, New York City, parts of Florida, and other landmasses throughout the world.
That‚Äôs scary.
But according to Cayce‚Äôs Earth Changes theory, it turns out that in addition to the changes that would alter the physical face of the world, there are ‚Äúsafe zones‚Äù that would ride out the earth changes, and in doing so provide a psychic focus for the energies needed to rebuild the world.
Where are those safe zones?
You guessed it‚Äîone of them is in rural Georgia. (See Exhibit 8B, page 56, for a map.)
It‚Äôs where the Guidestones stand, meaning they‚Äôre ready to help the survivors of the earth changes rebuild the world. And rebuild it better.
I believe that the Georgia Guidestones are, on one level, exactly what they appear to be‚Äîa tool for getting people to think about the nature of existence, and the ways in which that existence could be improved.
I think that there‚Äôs a good chance that the person behind them was a Rosicrucian.
But I also think that there‚Äôs a motivation for the stones that may have been overlooked, and that the motivation lies in the times during which they were commissioned and created.
The Georgia Guidestones came into being in the late 1970s and early 1980s‚Äîa time of enormous international tension between the United States and the then-existing Soviet Union. At the heart of those tensions: tens of thousands of nuclear warheads, an arsenal of destruction aimed at each other‚Äôs throats and more than capable of bringing civilization down in a mass of radioactive rubble.
They were among the scariest times in human history‚Äîand a reminder that we don‚Äôt need an apocalypse beyond our control to end the world. For more than half a century, we have held the power to do it ourselves. Self-inflicted genocide by nuclear bombs controlled by our governments: No secret cabals need apply.
And I think that it was the possibility of just such a nuclear holocaust that prompted R. C. Christian to create the message he placed on the Georgia Guidestones. A message intended for the survivors of a global nuclear holocaust. A message designed to help them restore a balance to the earth‚Äîand to avoid the mistakes that destroyed their ancestors.
That, I think, is the purpose of the Georgia Guidestones, and that‚Äôs the message we decoded during our investigation.
Of course, there‚Äôs one person, if he‚Äôs still alive, who knows whether or not my interpretation is accurate, and that‚Äôs R. C. Christian, but he‚Äôs not talking.
I just hope that he does come forth, and tell us whether or not any of our interpretations of the Georgia Guidestones are accurate. Or if there is another interpretation‚Äîperhaps brighter, perhaps darker‚Äîthat we may have overlooked.
Until then, we have the Georgia Guidestones themselves, speaking their message to the ages‚Äîand to each of us in their own way.

75 Facts About the Earth1. Earth is not a perfect sphere.Yes, we've all been taught that the Earth is not flat, but it may shock you to learn that it's not perfectly spherical either. As the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) points out, Earth spins while gravity pushes toward the center and a centrifugal force, perpendicular to Earth's axis, pushes out. This results in a bit of a tilted shape‚Äînot a perfect sphere.

Among other things, the movement seeks free association with and/or independence from the United States.Links:VERY IMPORTANT CHANNEL:¬†https://www.youtube.com/@jeffsnyder210/videosLahaina families hold press conference to address community, disaster response video:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLPvWd1FwcAHAWAII ELDER ON LAHAINA DEFIES JEW WORLD ORDER video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/UfrgcCy3gOvn/IWGIA website:¬†https://www.iwgia.org/en/usa/4688-iw-2022-hawai-i.htmlSupport Our Native Hawaiian Relatives video:¬†https://www.tiktok.com/@mercilesssavagez/video/7266290015011982622AINA MOMONA website:¬†https://www.kaainamomona.org/social-linksFlorida Nurse Warning video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/zp8VciuJDwx5/We're All Trapped In Here video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/tvyJLneCWwbU/massive plasma fire and social media blackout in Maui:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4-0OjRjCUMaui Fires Spawning Even More Mystery video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/P535PaYJvaJb/Government Coverup video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/5g5yCJhMa9SB/Exposed They're All In On It video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/vAqk9ljVufbJ/Some Important Info About Lasers video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/lDi26cktd0im/Remember The Blue Umbrellas In Lahaina video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/S59SZPCQunI5/Maui Fires Miraculously Missed Waterfront Mansions video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/3hkfZloa6oVq/Woman Sheds Light On The Shadiness And Corruption Of Maui Police Chief video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/ezqspa8CHXkx/Morningstar Report website:¬†https://robertmorningstar.substack.com/p/dew-attack-on-maui-looks-like-a-horizontal#%C2%A7did-a-dew-attack-make-maui-look-like-a-horizontal-hiroshimaThe Secret Covenant video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/EUNppYRqTL4b/Ultimate DEW Exhibition Of Plasma Fires video:¬†https://rumble.com/v2t9uu2-ultimate-dew-exhibition-of-plasma-fires-weapons-they-use-on-us-wake-up.htmlReinette Senum's Foghorn Express website/video:¬†https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/lahaina-a-modern-day-pearl-harbor#playStopTheCrime Great Info website:¬†https://mailchi.mp/arccopy/watches-evasive-actions-required-now?e=dced855ebdGeoffcygnus TIKTOK:¬†https://www.tiktok.com/@geoffcygnusDirect Energy Weapon On Maui website:¬†https://afresearchlab.com/technology/air-force-maui-optical-and-supercomputing-amos-site/The Island Next To Lahaina video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/qOrn4JzA0hxo/Shocking Eye Witness of Lahaina Maui Fire from Front Street Police Blocked Off the Exits video:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYN4eYySHJsMaui, Russia, Greece, Boulder and parachute Co., Cleveland Oh, Springville and nephi Ut, Arizona video:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVG1_p90McQTHE SHILLS and MASONIC SCUM:SGT Dan Dicks Shills Direction Away From DEW website/video:¬†https://www.sgtreport.com/2023/08/the-truth-about-the-maui-land-grabs-and-what-may-have-caused-the-fires/ClimateViewer Shills Direction Away From Truth video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/G5jgTbqHOuA/FakeNukes Channel Exposes Crisis Actors On Maui:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/channel/fakenukes/Talmudic Jew Scumbag Josh Green Bill To Steal Land From Native Hawaiians AGAIN pdf-¬†https://governor.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2307072-1.pdfHawaiiNewsNow Report On Talmudic Jew Josh Green's Plans To Steal Land video:¬†https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2023/07/17/governor-set-announce-emergency-proclamation-housing/Hawaii Exec Order video:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/jNRve22lFoGf/Show more

https://rumble.com/v1cgtjn-psychological-effects-of-face-masks-stop-wearing-them-r-u-a-slave.html THROW THEM AWAY!!! DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN LIES AND FEAR!!!MY STATEMENTIt is time to take a STAND World. The governments of the world have been TAKEN OVER. A global coup has occurred. This is no longer a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù. I have been saying this for 2 years now. Serve God or serve satan, by default. And we are WARNED about pagan gods (Buddha, Allah=deception). There is only ONE God. One Creator. Freemasonry, which rules the world, IS satan in disguise. We are told he is legion, many. Many names, all ‚Äògoddesses‚Äô and gender-less gods. Trans. Baphomet. And Satan is behind EVERY evil agenda you see playing out. The vaccine, the fake plandemics, the fake VARIANTS, the wearing of the mask, the stand 6 6 6 feet apart, the TRANS agenda to subvert & enslave future generations: they are RITUALS. SATANIC rituals. Satanists are running things. Don‚Äôt believe me? See Altiyan Child‚Äôs vid ONHERE: THE WORLDS SECRET RELIGION ‚Äì which is Satanism hidden behind, and within, Freemasonry). DO NOT PARTICIPATE. DO NOT GIVE IN! RESIST! We are IN the last battle. Good vs. Evil. Choose your side.They HAVE hijacked the world. They are ALL Freemasons. All secret transgender (baphomets). They are the ENEMY of humanity with a nefarious end goal. And they are completing their ‚Äúgreat work‚Äù for the architect THEY worship: lucifer (BAPHOMET‚Äîthus the push to transition your children!). They are plunging the world into darkness, chaos and death, turning us against each other rather than THEM, and they are destroying our food supply with evil intent. They are creating famine. Homelessness. They are the ones creating these horrific weather events while blaming us and claiming ‚Äòclimate change‚Äô when YES, THEY CONTROL THE WEATHER!!! THEY ARE THE ONES ‚ÄúCHANGING‚Äù the climate! Geo-engineering is real. Check out WeatherWar 101. As they drive around with their SUVs and private jets blaming us for what they are doing. To instill FEAR. All lies. Look up HAARP. Geoengineering. Nexrad Doppler, 5G. DEW. Operation Popeye, Operation Crimson Mist. They have controlled weather for over 70 years! We are being poisoned in every way possible.They do not even HIDE it anymore. The writings of Alice Bailey, whom the World Economic Forum members WORSHIP, and writings of Helen Blavatsky CLEARLY STATE that in order to enter their New World Order, you MUST take a Luciferian pledge. That is: To worship lucifer. Agreement of any kind IS acceptance: Taking the the MRNA DNA CHANGING shots, taking a KNEE (yes, they used the BLM movement for him), transforming your body for satan (TRANS-AGENDA=replacing GODs image with satans) SO TAKE A STAND OR WORSHIP THE DEVIL BY DEFAULT.People are being MURDERED by these death shots. Children are dying. Your family members are DYING! Everyone is sick with ‚Äòcovid‚Äô who took the shot. Hospitals and doctors globally have been BOUGHT and are profiting off YOUR MISERY with death protocols, openly killing people w false ‚Äúcovid‚Äù diagnosis, killer vents & REMDESIVIR. Everyone put on a vent will die! Do u not get it? Hospitals get PAID to do this! Influencer‚Äôs on social media get PAID to lie to you. Phizer OWNS the ‚Äúnews‚Äù. Millions have been PERMANENTLY DISABLED! This a major DEPOPULATION AGENDA! It is anti-life, anti-humanity. The Antichrist is HERE. Look around. I see so many people who are willfully ignorant, who will NOT admit this is happening, and who chose instead to live in a fantasy. I remember seeing a headline read, in 2020, THE FLU DISAPPEARED. And thinking, are people really this stupid? Why yes, yes they are. They cannot put two and two together.The entire world has been DECEIVED via the media with FEAR, fake numbers and fake deaths at the beginning of ‚Äòcovid‚Äô. They literally labeled EVERY death a ‚Äúcovid‚Äù death in the beginning. It was only real on the TELL-LIES-VISION. There are no ‚Äòvariants‚Äô floating around in the air. The hospitals WERE NOT overflowing! I saw for myself 3 empty hospitals in Atlanta, GA at the height of the programming! EMPTY. The establishment merely replaced the word ‚Äúflu‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù with the anagram ‚Äúcovid‚Äù which actually stands for CERTIFICATE OF VACCINATION IDENTIFICATION. ID2020 This is Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 being enacted, do not trust ME rather go to the UN& WEF websites to confirm all that I‚Äôve said.They are trying DESPERATELY to cover up VACCINE GENOCIDE with a bunch of ridiculousness, calling the REAL Mrna vaccine GENOCIDE ‚Äúsudden adult death syndrome‚Äù and making excuses for 5 & 7 year old vaxxed kids & teens having strokes and heart attacks. Telling you naps cause heart attacks and taking a shower causes strokes. Athletes dropping dead left and right. Really people? I PRAY you can see through the LIES. And u say NO to new lock-downs, mask mandates, fake climate lock-downs are coming (BTW, a mandate is not a LAW, know your rights). Please understand that THE COVID JABS ARE SET TO BE COMPULSORY for EVERYONE in 2023. And they WILL be tied to the QR code digital system and a ‚Äòsocial credit score‚Äù. They are trying to roll out the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) which will eliminate cash and all crypto except the Central Bank, who will control us completely and DECIDE FOR US what can and cannot be bought‚Äîbased on ‚Äòpolitical correctness‚Äô. It IS the Beast System. Choose your side now! God or satan. This is an epic battle between good and evil playing out in society. It is THAT simple. PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN!It says in the Bible that ALL nations were deceived by what? Their ‚Äòpharmakeia‚Äô (medicine/magic/pharmacy/INJECTIONS). And this is happening everywhere. Even with concrete proof, people cannot ACCEPT their government would lie TO THEM. Actually try to KILL THEM. I write this estranged from all I love. Ive lost many to the jab. But God is WITH ME. I have done my research, now do YOUR own. I leave all the links and sources for you to find the truth. Open up your Bible and read Revelations. It is HERE. Please take this SERIOUSLY. This IS a spiritual Matter. Satan wants your soul. This is about YOUR SOUL.Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ IS the son of God, that he died for you so you may have life. Accept his sacrifice on the cross (he died on a cross, not on a tree as it now says in the Bible). Repent of your sins and do not continue to sin. Yes, this means you must CHANGE. Turn off the TV and the dummy phone and GET RIGHT WITH GOD! EVERYONE on the tell-lies-vision worship the enemy. ALL OF THEM!! Devices like ‚Äòsmartphones‚Äô are meant to separate us from GOD and distract us and program us. Reject all of it! Do it now, before it is too late! I love you all.

JESUS CHRIST IS THE WORD OF GOD (John 1:1 and Revelations 19:13) and the WORD OF GOD endures forever. 2 THESS 2:8-11 REVELATIONS 22:18-19 AMOS 8:!1 DANIEL 7:25 2 TIMOTHY 4:4 ROMANS 1:25 JEREMIAH 31:33 HEBREWS 8:10 HEBREWS 10:16All of the Pastors you see on TV are FREEMASONS. They do NOT worship God. Their god is LUCIFER. If they are throwing up the devil horns and pyramids, giving u the V for baphomet, signaling they are TRANS, DO NOT follow these deceivers (Joel Olsteen, Hillsong, Joyce Meyers, Kenneth, Copeland, basically ALL of them ‚Äì they are all signed on with the Vatican to promote the new age. Luciferian one-world religion of Chis-lam and WILL enforce the Sunday Law). Note: Any church that closed down and opened only to push the death vaxx are compromised. They are 501(c)3 CORPORATIONS dependent on government funding and were paid very well to help push the government genocidal depopulation agenda onto their parishioners.""What! Know ye not that YOUR BODY is the TEMPLE of the HOLY SPIRIT, which is IS YOU, which ye have OF GOD, and Ye are not your own?"" 1 Corin 6:19Do NOT let your temple be defiled!!!! Fight for it. Protect it! Protect your children!!!TRAN*S*AGENDA: DESTROYING THE TEMPLE OF GOD mutilation/castration = depopulation AGENDA & THE war on our CHILDRENI'm only trying to EXPOSE the deception. I do not HATE anyone. I DO hate being deceived by men pretending to be women and vice versa. I am adverse to MEN pretending to be be female, telling REAL women to get abortions and pushing feminism on real women. Men claiming to get pregnant and have wombs. MEN and PEDOPHILES invading sacred women‚Äôs SPACES including bathrooms, shelters, gyms, and locker rooms and deliberately exposing themselves while claiming to be us when they have MALE GENITALIA. I AM adverse to the WAR ON BIOLOGICAL WOMEN & the war on biological men also (the feminization of biological men‚Äîthe overall emasculation of men). I am ADVERSE to MALE TRANSVESTITES confusing & HARMING our children in schools and libraries and the GROOMING of our children. The promotion of the delusion that one can change Gods creation. The idea that at 5 a child can be put on hormones, puberty blockers and have their ability to reproduce destroyed forever is TRAGIC. Destroying childrens future: their ability to reproduct or ever have normal sex lives are being destroyed. Those advocating this type of open CHILD ABUSE is more disturbing every day! Nonprofits are pushing the lie, churches, schools. And I will fight it for my two granddaughters. I do hate the LIES and I feel moved by God to Expose THESE LIES! And trust me, exposing these lies and standing for what is RIGHT in a world that no longer has MORALS or VALUES, that‚Äôs been flipped on its head, has cost me EVERYTHING. I have lost everyone I ever loved or cared about due to the genocide and for going AGAINST the cult herd mentality.We have been DECEIVED to an unfathomable degree. The lies of the gender CULT is causing the gender confusion among our children. The LGBTQ (and now they want to add a P for PEDOPHILE) movement is ANTI-FAMILY, a literal WAR on ALL biological men and women and I thank God I am NOT a part of it anymore. I do NOT discriminate OR HATE any gay or lesbians, but I hope to witness to them re: TRUTH. Because I too, was indoctrinated and mind-controlled before coming to Christ. I ‚Äúidentified‚Äô as bisexual before waking up and giving my life back to Jesus Christ, and was PART of the problem! I can now see how I was conditioned by the mind-control of Hollywood, subversive literature/advertising and deceived from childhood and abuse to have been so confused about gender: conditioned by movies and music that exists for the sole purpose of erasing God. Deceived into thinking I was bisexual by feeling attracted to these deceiving MEN pretending to be real women in hollywood, on the news, I can now SEE all these women I idolized were MEN (without exception).I HAVE REPENTED! I fight NOW so my grandchildren, BOTH GIRLS, might be free of that, AND KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HOLLYWOOD MIND (CON)TROL. And to open the eyes of my fellow man. What is now happening in our schools is absolutely CRIMINAL. As yourself why these grown MEN NEED to flaunt around schools, churches and libraries wearing grotesque SCARY make-up like the clowns they are, dressed like strippers (MOCKING BIOLOGICAL WOMEN--REAL women would NEVER behave this way in public) and TRAUMATIZING our children! Do you KNOW EVIL when you SEE it??? Its absolutely demonic. We must RESIST this new (DEMONIC) world order AND THE ENTIRE TRANS AGENDA which is their attempt to ERASE THE IMAGE GOD. TURN TO GOD TODAY!! Refuse to use their satanic false ‚Äúpronouns and language‚Äù Do not PARTICipATE in idiocracy!!! Use your VOICE!!! REAL WOMEN DO NOT NEED PRONOUNS! THESE PRONOUNS ARE MENTAL ILLNESS and LIES! REAL WOMEN STAND UP NOW!!!

In a dictatorship people obey out of basic fear of the dictator at the top.MASS FORMATION needs 4 conditions to take place. This has now happened:‚Äú30% of people are deeply hypnotized.40% are not, but go along with the crowd. If this 40% stop hearing dissenting voices of reason, They will unite with the hypnotized to go along with the plan.We are the last section, the 30% that cannot be hypnotized. We must keep speaking out. In totalitarianism when the last voices of dissent give up and become silent - the mass then starts committing atrocities for the sake of the solidarity and of the collective.Professor Desmet says the hypnotism and mass formation he now sees is a condition clearly leading to totalitarianism. in a totalitarian state, once-normal people commit atrocities thinking they are righteous.===============It's the Mark of the Beast - take it and you lose your eternity ‚ÄìIF U TOOK THIS VACCINE BRING IT TO GOD.

They are an intro-body nano network administered through injection. What they are finding in people are NOT blood-clots. This injection IS self-replicating, self-assembling nanotechnology which contains GRAPHENE. Lipid nano-particles that have been MODIFIED ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL; wrapped in pegulation-polyethelene-glycol (one of the components used to make hydro-gel. The lipid particles are modified to be more sensitive to HEAT and FREQUENCY (5G). They contain LUCIFERASE to make the marked glow under certain light.When placed in the human body they become excited by the heat, with that excitement they vibrate with the excitement and MAGNETOFCTION is created and the particles slowly drift towards each other; hence self-assembly. This inter-body nanotechnology. is the FIRST STEP IN MAKING THE HUMAN BODY A DEVICE, linking it to the INTERNET OF BODIES. These MRNA injections also CHANGES HUMAN DNA, rendering a person into a GMO (genetically modified organism) now OWNED BY THE CORPORATION that administered the injection. This allows for the system to freely HARVEST psychological, biological, genetic and physiological data from the individual without their knowledge or consent. They are now PRODUCTS owned by the corporation (Pfizer, Moderna, etc). At the top of all these corporations is Black Rock and Vanguard. INFORMATION is the new goal & will be the foundation for the new cashless, digital financial system coming. The CBCD.THE NEXT STEP is a quantum-dot MRNA tattoo for the fake covid-19, that will slowly release quantum dots (micro-chips) into the human body. It will individualize and AUTHENTICATE all data for each individual. This is the GOAL of the TRANS HUMAN AGENDA being INITIATED on the human population without their KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT by the global elitists, working primarily through the WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM and the WHO (WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION), the IMF, and other global control systems not part of any one government.THIS TECHNOLOGY, if it does not kills you, will link every human into the INTERNET OF BODIES. It IS the foundation for a GLOBAL CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) that will be controlled via quantum systems. This technology has the capacity to FULLY MONITOR AND CONTROL every individual who takes it. This IS the final Mark of the Beast, and the only way out is NON-COMPLIANCE.

#despensadealimentos #inseguridadalimentaria #CFCMarietta #CobbCounty #11julio #HISPATLANTA #Atlanta", right here in the Faroaks community there's a really large Hispanic population. Many of them are facing higher rates of food insecurity and we need to get them access to more food. Not just food but the kinds of foods that are really important culturally to those families and we got to have the right kind of service here so we've got a Spanish speaking staff who are here to really be welcoming and inclusive for all the families we're trying to serve in Faroaks. We know it's a big need and we're excited to help provide a better resource for this community.,no longer populated,,2023-07-23T16:46:38.000Z,post data removed,,20.0,0.0,0.0,2020.0,,,

As one of the 11 selected Fellows representing Sierra Leone, Rugiatu joins a cohort of 700 young leaders from across Africa to engage in leadership development activities at various prestigious U.S. educational institutions. Through her business, Slay Farms, Rugiatu is nurturing not just crops but also a community of women farmers. On her 10-acre farm, she shares her extensive knowledge of sustainable agricultural practices with other women, fostering a network of empowered individuals with a common goal. The farm serves as a hub for learning events, where women gather to exchange expertise and stay updated on the latest advancements in sustainable farming techniques. Moreover, Slay Farms acts as a link, connecting these farmers with wider markets for their produce, thus ensuring economic growth for the entire community. During her time as a Mandela Washington Fellow, Rugiatu Favour Kanu had the opportunity to visit the Metro Atlanta Urban Farm in the USA. There, she encountered Bobby Wilson, an enthusiastic urban farmer whose dedication to providing food for those in need has earned him recognition as one of CNN's top ten heroes in the family category. Rugiatu was inspired by the farm's emphasis on giving back to the community and the crucial role urban agriculture plays in sustainable food production. As part of her commitment to volunteerism and giving back, Rugiatu and her fellow Fellows joined forces at the Atlanta Community Food Bank. They passionately packed food and assembled health kits, driven by the desire to make a positive impact on the lives of those less fortunate. In this act of selflessness, the Fellows found unity despite their diverse backgrounds and experiences, resonating with the transformative power of community service. Rugiatu Favour Kanu's work exemplifies the spirit of the Mandela Washington Fellowship and the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), representing the United States' dedication to investing in the future of Africa. Through sustainable farming and empowering women, Rugiatu is leaving a lasting impact on her community, bridging gaps and fostering a brighter, more equitable future for Sierra Leone and beyond.

That&#39;s right. And city officials were not lettingy questions slip in at all 11 liv. Bobeth Yates was there.
So, beau Beth, how did this meeting
kick off? Well, that city work session went
off without
a hitch, the mayor only addressing the mr very briefly, but only to say te will be a time to discuss the i. But city officials were adamantt they will not be speaking
on the topic. Take a look at City of South Fu. Employees physically
blocked the media from interacting with
council members. Each person physically escortedt of the work session
to avoid answering questions about the incident tht landed Mayor Khalid Kamau
behind bars. I came here tonight just to see hw the meat would run after all the drama over the last weekend. S Fulton resident Kelvin
Bennett was among many wanting to see
if the city would address Mayor Kamalu being arred and charged with criminal
trespassing. And burglary. But the matter was only mentioned briefly by the m, who said this was not
the time to
speak on the issue. When you listen
to the reports, you know, you, you ask yourself, you know, OK, trespassing. I get it. You know, burglary, if you look at the house, looks like it&#39;s falling into a , you know, I mean, burglarized. What? And resident Malcolm Witcd also shared his concerns. I dont think the city was moving in the right direction before the whole incident happened. So I think the situation needs to be addressed. I think that. Someone needs to call into quesn why the person that
held a gun
to the city&#39;s mayor has not been arres. And while someone answers, others have a sharp stance on the issue. We&#39;ve gotten so much negative publicity since our birth, just a lot of news that has not shown us in the best light. And this for me was the straw that broke the camels back. So I honestly think that the mar needs to step down 11 alive dide digging and found the mayor is just one of several. People who have been arrested ad charged with burglary for enterg the property on the 600 block of Cascade Palmetto Highway Monday. We spoke to a realtor who currey is battling his own arrest in c, but he decided not to comment. It&#39;s an odd
situation,
you know. Khalid has been speaking out against the Police Department ad and possible corruption within e government and then this happen. Now, city officials will meet again next Tuesday.

All That Is Necessary For The Evil To Triumph Is That A Good Men Or Women Or Trans And Other Sexes Do Nothing New World Order?
We live in the world where sex is free and love costs, where losing a phone is scarier than losing morale, where it is fashionable to get drunk and using drugs, because if you don‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôre old and out, where men cheat on their wives with girls and if they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs for fear of being caught, where girls are more afraid of being pregnant than getting AIDS, where pizza delivery is faster than an ambulance, where clothes decide a person‚Äôs value and money is more important than friends and family... This is not my world. Where has my world gone?A conspiracy theory is an explanation for an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy by sinister and powerful groups, often political in motivation, when other explanations are more probable. The term has a negative connotation, implying that the appeal to a conspiracy is based on prejudice or insufficient evidence.
Freedom‚Äôs Just Another Word For Nothing Left To Lose‚Ä¶ 1984 ?Do you really believe that all children born ought to have equal opportunities for successful lives? Really?And how far exactly do you want the government go in order to guarantee this?How should we guarantee the child of a drug addicted homeless woman the same shot at success as a home-schooled child from a caring intact family?Should parents be able to bequeath their assets to their children or is the death tax a moral attempt to provide all children the same shot at success?Does a religious upbringing confer an unfair advantage on some children?Why isn‚Äôt it just a little immoral to care so much more about one‚Äôs own children than about all the other children in society?Politics is nothing more than the practical application of our most deeply held moral values.

When anger is misdirected, it's focused on the wrong person or source. Believe it or not, instances of displaced anger occur more often than most people realize. Situations and things are not always what they appear to be, and, sometimes, it can be challenging to see beyond the smoke and mirrors. This is why it's so important to be aware of the situation and cognizant of the factors involved when you're feeling angry.
Georgia Guidestones Inscriptions - A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Traditional Chinese, and Russian.1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.2. Guide reproduction wisely‚Äîimproving fitness and diversity.3. Unite humanity with a living new language.4.

What‚Äôs the Difference Between Equity and Equality?Even if you take the time to search the words equity and equality in the dictionary, you might walk away thinking they mean the same thing. Merriam-Webster defines equitable as ‚Äúdealing fairly and equally with all concerned,‚Äù and equal as ‚Äúof the same measure, quantity, amount, or number as another.‚Äù However, much like systemic and systematic, the two words (and their derivatives) can‚Äôt be used interchangeably.Equality has to do with giving everyone the exact same resources.Equity involves distributing resources based on the needs of the recipients.On the left side of the illustration above, for example, three identical boxes are given to three people of different heights‚Äîit‚Äôs an equal distribution of resources, but it fails to consider that the tallest person doesn‚Äôt need a box to see over the fence, while the shortest person could clearly use an extra one. When the boxes are redistributed equitably, as seen on the right side of the illustration, all three spectators can watch the game.As George Washington University‚Äôs Milken Institute School of Public Health explains, recognizing the difference between equality and equity is important in just about every sphere of life: public health, politics, education, racial justice, and more. If each public school in a certain county receives 150 new laptops, that‚Äôs technically equal. But it doesn‚Äôt factor in that some of those schools might be located in high-income districts where most of the students already have their own laptops. Instead, officials should allocate the devices according to which schools have the greatest need for them‚Äîthat way, they can minimize the chance that dozens of laptops will end up gathering dust at one school, while another doesn't have enough to go around.To summarize, equality is about dividing resources in matching amounts, and equity focuses more on dividing resources proportionally to achieve a fair outcome for those involved.
Never stay in a place where no one see your value.A father said to his daughter ‚ÄúYou have graduated with honors, here is a car I bought many years ago.It is a bit older now but before I give it to you, take it to the used car lot downtown and tell them you want to sell it and see how much they offer you for it.The daughter went to the used car lot, returned to her father and said, ‚ÄúThey offered me $1,000 because they said it looks pretty worn out.‚ÄùThe father said, now ‚ÄúTake it to the pawn shop.‚Äù The daughter went to the pawn shop, returned to her father and said,‚ÄùThe pawn shop offered only $100 because it is an old car.‚ÄùThe father asked his daughter to go to a car club now and show them the car. The daughter then took the car to the club, returned and told her father,‚Äù Some people in the club offered $100,000 for it because it‚Äôs a Rare Lina RXT 1980 Only One Made and it's an iconic car and sought by many collectors‚ÄùNow the father said this to his daughter, ‚ÄúThe right place values you the right way,‚Äù If you are not valued, do not be angry, it means you are in the wrong place. Those who know your value are those who appreciate you. Never stay in a place where no one sees your value.
The Georgia Guidestones are a granite monument erected in 1980 in Elbert County, Georgia, in the United States. A set of ten guidelines is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient language scripts.
The monument stands at an approximate elevation of 750 feet (230 m) above sea level, about 90 miles (140 km) east of Atlanta, 45 miles (72 km) from Athens, Georgia.

Welcome To The New World Order - The Year Zero - National Anthem of the United States of America and Confederate States of America and New World Order National Anthem ""The Ostrich"" Lyrics in 1968 A.C.E.The Conspiracy to Rule Your Mind chronicles how the ruling elite have established global domination and the ability to effect the thoughts, decisions, and world view of human beings across the globe by systematically infiltrating the media, academia, industry, military and political factions under the guise of upholding democracy.Learn how this malevolent consortium has dedicated centuries to realize an oppressive and totalitarian rule through any means necessary, not limited to drug trafficking, money laundering, terror attacks and financial crisis within the world economy.Worldwide tyranny is already in full effect, the food we eat and the air we breathe are not off limits.

Like Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), Secret Cold War experiments tested various drugs during unethical human experimentation in the United States. These hallucinogenic drugs (See also psychosomatic medicine) antagonize psychological phenomena, which may explain (but not conclusively) seeing ""aliens"" during abductions.3-hydroxy-1-methyl-5,6-in doline-dione Adrenochrome is an oxidation product of adrenaline (ephinephrine, norepinephrine). The effects and classification of this drug is said to be controversial because it is debated whether is has any psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects, although some test subjects compared the adrenochrome experience to mild psilocybin and LSD experiences.We decode the Monsters Inc, Coma and Dragnet films, examining the foundations of adrenochrome science and how it relates MK Ultra Media Programming and the pineal gland. Adrenochrome is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C9H9NO3 produced by the oxidation of adrenaline.

This is O.K. but I Think its Wrong about Stopping Social Security's Trust Fund Back by Gold ? Is fully solvent until 2033 ? and is sourced from FICA, SECA, Income Tax and interest.Social Security trust funds are financial accounts in the U.S. Treasury. There are two separate Social Security trust funds, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund pays retirement and survivors benefits, and the Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund pays disability benefits.
Social Security Is Gone and Remember, not only did you and I contribute to Social Security, but your employer did, too. It totals 15% of your income before taxes. If you averaged only $30K over your working life, that's close to $220,500. Read that again!
Did you see where the Government paid in one single penny?We are talking about the money you and your employer put in a Government bank to insure you and I that we would have a retirement check from the money we put in, not the Government. Now they are calling the money we put in an ENTITLEMENT when we reach the age to take it back.
If you calculate the future invested value of $4,500 per year (yours & your employer's contribution) at a simple 5% interest (less than what the Government pays on the money that it borrows), after 49 years of working you'd have $892,919.98.
If you took out only 3% per year, you'd receive $26,787.60 per year and it would last better than 30 years (until you're 95 if you retire at age 65) and that's with no interest paid on that final amount on deposit! If you bought an annuity and it paid 4% per year, you'd have a lifetime income of $2,976.40 per month.
If you have a deceased spouses who died in their 50's -- their S.S. money will never have one cent drawn from what they paid into S.S. all their lives over the past 30 years!
Entitlement my foot, I paid cash for my social security insurance! Just because they borrowed the money for other government spending, doesn't make my benefits some kind of charity or handout!! Remember Congressional benefits? --- free healthcare, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days.
Now that's welfare!!! And they have the nerve to call my social security retirement payments entitlements?!?
They call Social Security and Medicare an entitlement even though most of us have been paying for it all our working lives, and now, when it's time for us to collect, the government is running out of money.
Why did the government borrow from it in the first place? It was supposed to be in a locked box back by gold, not part of the general fund.
Something to ponder:History Lesson on Your Social Security CardJust in case some of you young whippersnappers (and some older ones) didn't know this. It's easy to check out, if you don't believe it. Be sure and show it to your familyand friends. They need a little history lesson on what's what and it doesn't matter whether you are Democrat or Republican. Facts are Facts.Social Security Cards up until the 1980s expressly stated the number and Card were not to be used for identification purposes. Since nearly everyone in the United States now has a number, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message, NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION was removed.An old Social Security card with the ""NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION"" message.Our Social Security Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program. He promised:1) That participation in the Program would be completely voluntary, No longer Voluntary2) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, Now 7.65% On the first $90,000.3) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, No longer tax deductible4) That the money the participants put in went to the Independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the General Operating Fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program, and, Under Johnson the money was moved to The General Fund and spent.5) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. Under Clinton & Gore up to 85% of your Social Security can be taxed. Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to 'put away -- you may be interested in the following:------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the Independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the General Fund so that Congress could spend it?A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the Democratically controlled House and Senate.------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding?A: The Democratic Party.------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -----Q: Which Political Party started taxing SocialSecurity annuities?A: The Democratic Party with Al Gore casting the 'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the U.S.------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -Q: Which Political Party decided to startgiving annuity payments to immigrants?(AND MY FAVORITE):A: That's right!Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party.Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive Social Security payments! The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it!------------ -- ------------ --------- ----- ------------ --------- ---------Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away! And the worst part about it is uninformed citizens believe it! If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe changes will evolve. But it's worth a try. How many people can YOU send this to? Actions speak louder than bumper stickers.
32 Shocking Sexual Assault Statistics for 2023 At present, sexual assaults are the most prevalent crimes in the US, yet also the most underreported.
Over the last two decades, much work has been dedicated to change the landscape of sexual assault and to empower victims of this type of crime.
But the thing is:
Despite several helpful, progressive reforms, sexual assault statistics reflect that many crimes are still not fully addressed or understood.
Which is why:
It is important that we analyze and address the strengths and weaknesses of the current approach with the help of the latest sexual harassment statistics in order to understand what needs improving and where.
With that said, let‚Äôs dive right in.
Alarming Sexual Violence Statistics (Editor‚Äôs Choice)One of the most shocking facts about sexual assault is that approximately only 5% of sexual assault reports filed have been proven false.82% of all juvenile sexual assault victims are female.90% of adult rape victims are female.41% of sexual assaults against Native Indians are committed by a stranger.Adolescents aged 14‚Äê17 were by far the most likely to be sexually victimized; nearly one in six (16.3%) was sexually victimized in the past year.General Statistics about Sexual AssaultAlthough statistics on sexual assault can‚Äôt even begin to convey the suffering of victims and their families, they can offer a glimpse into the disturbing extent of the issue.
1. In 2019, over 652,676 women were raped.This figure excludes non-rape sexual assaults but includes date rape statistics; if included, data from non-rape sexual assaults would take the figure closer to the one million mark. What‚Äôs worse, it has been rising for the last decade at an annual rate of 2.9%, and this trend shows no sign of decreasing.
2. Over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence.Sexual abuse, as shown by rape and sexual assault statistics, has affected 41.8% of women in the US who have been victimized by sexual violence other than rape.
3. Nearly 80% of female sexual assault victims experience their first assault before the age of 25.Exactly 79.6% of female victims who have experienced one or more completed rape did so before the age of 25.
4. Around 20% of American males have been the victim of sexual violence.According to Rainn statistics, outside of the correctional system, most rape victims are female. However, studies show that 21.4% of males in the US have been the victims of sexual violence and have experienced this outside of any prison facility.
5. A quarter of male victims of sexual assault were under 10 years of age.According to studies, an estimated total of 28% of male victims of sexual assault in the US will have experienced their first assault at 10 years of age or younger.
6. Rape Statistics show that less than 20% of rapes are reported.It is estimated that only 19% of rapes, completed or attempted, are reported annually. This figure runs consistently across the board. The general consensus is that rape is still considered something shameful, hence victim reluctance.
7. Women and men with disabilities face twice the risk of sexual assault than able-bodied individuals.Sadly, data gathered from watchdog organizations and US sexual assault statistics have found that disabled people were twice as likely to be victims of sexual assault than able-bodied people. Statistics of sexual abuse show that the majority of these heinous assaults were carried out in care environments (both facilities and home care). Yet, they were also reported as taking place during hospital or general practitioner sessions, as well as in individual therapy sessions.
8. Nearly 20,000 sexual assaults were reported in the military last year.A study on the level of sexual assault within the military from 2010 revealed sexual violence statistics that showed a figure of 3,577, of which only a quarter took place during deployment in combat zones.
The study was repeated in 2019, and the sexual assault stats showed over 19,000 sexual assaults had now taken place in the US military.
9. 7.2% of all children surveyed in 2019 had been victims of sexual assault.Child sexual abuse statistics highlight the harrowing revelation that teens aged 14 to 17 were in the highest risk category for sexual assault, with more than one in four adolescents (27.3%) having been sexually victimized during their lifetimes.
10. Approximately 70 women commit suicide every day in the US following an act of sexual violence.Women sexual assault statistics reveal some extremely disturbing facts. An estimated 70 women commit suicide daily in the US, directly as a result of sexual violence. Worryingly, this figure has grown by 2.87% over the last year.
11. Sexual violence incidents, preceded by stalking, increased by 1.9% in 2019.According to statistics and sexual harassment facts from 2019, the incidents of stalking that led to sexual assaults have increased steadily over the last year. What makes this figure even more alarming is the fact that initiatives were put in place to prevent and protect victims from such occurrences. So, governmental legislation and thinking about the issue must be reviewed.
12. During 2019, 13% of all women in California were victims of rape.Sexual harassment statistics reflect a large percentage of Californian women have been reported as having been a victim to an attempted or completed rape in 2019. Current rape statistics by state show that 13% of all Californian women are in danger of being a victim of sexual assault.
13. Statistics show that 1 in 6 US women will be raped annually in the US.Surveys and rape statistics by gender have found that 1 in 6 American women, and 1 in 33 American men has experienced an attempted/completed rape as a child or adult. This disturbing figure has been predicted to rise exponentially over the next three years.
14. Over 1.5 million women were raped by an intimate partner in 2019.Statistics on sexual harassment from the Department of Justice suggest that over 1.5 million women and 834,700 men are raped and/or physically assaulted annually by an intimate partner in the United States. This staggering figure is both disheartening and unnerving.
Experts have created focus groups to analyze and explore these sexual assault statistics by state in more depth.
Little Known Facts About Male Victims of Sexual ViolenceAccording to sexual assault statistics, males are also high-risk victims of sexual violence.
Which means that:
Sexual abuse is not limited to females, and the abuse of boys has little to do with either the abuser‚Äôs or the victim‚Äôs sexual orientation.
Perhaps unsurprisingly:
Male rape statistics show that most perpetrators of male sexual assault are men. These predators choose to rape both gay or straight men because rape is an act of aggression and domination, not of sexual desire.
Contrary to popular belief:
Girls and women can most definitely be perpetrators of sexual violence toward males, and instances of this kind are more prevalent in society than most people realize.
In contradiction to the sweeping statement thinking of most people, male sexual assault statistics have now proved that most males who experience sexual assault (at any age) do not automatically go on to become sexual abusers.
In many cases:
According to gun violence statistics, attackers can use various weapons, physical force, or even the threat of force to gain the upper hand. Others, according to rape victim statistics, may use blackmail or their position of authority to threaten someone into submission.
15. Approximately 16% of males in juvenile prisons have been sexually abused.A 2019 study by the US Center for Disease Control examined woman rape statistics in juvenile prisons for incidents and frequency of sexual violence. The results showed that 16% of males had been victims of sexual abuse, whereas over 60% of males in these facilities had encountered the threat of sexual violence.
16. In Florida alone, a staggering total of 1,477,000 men have been victim to sexual assault.In Florida, 20.4% of men, or 1,477,000 men, have been victimized by sexual violence over the last decade.
17. Over 25% of male sexual assault victims will experience their first assault before 10 years of age.According to sexual assault statistics 2019, studies and statistical analysis, in excess of 25% (27.8% to be exact) of male victims of sexual assault will probably experience their first attack by age 10 or younger.
18. Nearly 40% of adult males that experience sexual violence from an intimate partner are left with psychological scarring.Reports and studies on US rape statistics show clearly that 39.7% of men who have experienced sexual assault from their partner such as rape, stalking or physical violence, are left with long term impacts such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other types of psychological injury.
19. New York statistics show that 18% of all rapes in the city involved a male victim.According to rape statistics, extensive studies, and focus groups, 2019 involved a record high of male rape victims within the city, with a record high figure of 18% - which is 5.7% higher than 2018.
Sexual Assault Effects on Society20. Over 80% of sexual assaults are committed by an acquaintance.Relatives, teachers, religious leaders, former spouses - unfortunately, the list of possible attackers is one of people who will most often have a very intimate relationship with the victim. Statistics on rape indicate that this connection normally results in most rape victims shying away from reporting such incidents due to obligatory or emotional pressures.
21. Almost 95% of child victims knew their sexual attacker.Rape stats by RAINN show that the vast majority percentage (93.98%) of child victims in the US in 2019 were familiar with their attacker. In almost all of these cases, as reflected by teenage sexual assault statistics, the child had spent a significant amount of time (10 plus hours, in one full duration or segmented) with their attacker prior to the sexual assault taking place.
22. The rate of false rape claims in the US is well below the 10% average mark.Although false rape claims do happen, it is important to keep in mind that the majority of rape claims are legitimate, as sexual assault statistics reveal.
In fact, data collated in 2019 from false rape statistics, shows that a combined rate of 6.9% of rape claims were false.
23. Sexual assaults cost the US billions of dollars annually.Findings from college sexual assault statistics and other reports show that although sexual assaults take heinous tolls on their victims and cause terrible emotional damage, there is another cost that is rarely factored into such tragic events - the cost on society in financial terms.
According to stats on sexual abuse, when we factor in the costs of funding and running sexual assault services, the resulting lower educational aspirations (a common affliction amongst adolescents who have been the victim of child abuse), and the cost of lost earnings of victims who have been traumatized to a point where they are unable to work, the costs on the US annually are in excess of $450 billion. A staggering figure on paper, and one that has, according to stats on sexual assault, been increasing yearly by 1.8% on average.
24. 69% of rape victims in the US are women aged between 12 to 34 years old.Sexual violence figures from 2019 were significantly higher compared to sexual assault statistics 2018. The 12-34 age bracket has been known to encompass the majority of rape victims in the US on an average year.
25. Transgender college students have a 5% higher rate of getting raped than other students.After conducting studies on sexual assault statistics by gender, US colleges have reported a rise in sexual attacks on transgender students. College rape statistics about transgender, genderqueer, and gender-nonconforming (TGQN) students have shown that in 2019 an average of 23% of students were in danger of being sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN students. These stats are concerning because they are significantly higher than college sexual assault statistics 2018, which means the problem is getting out of control.
26. Bisexual women are more than twice as likely to victims of rape than straight women.Of all the women at the greatest risk from sexual assault in the US, bisexual women are statistically in the danger zone. Sexual abuse statistics show that 46% of bisexual women reported being a victim of sexual assault in 2019, compared to 17% of straight women.
Furthermore, sexual assault on college campuses statistics show an interesting correlation, which reveals that bisexual men face similar issues, with 47% of them being victims of sexual violence, compared to 21% of heterosexual men.
27. The majority (90%) of rape victims are female.Findings from sexual assault reporting statistics have unsurprisingly revealed that women make up the vast majority of rape victims. This figure reflects rape statistics US and includes adult victims but excludes juvenile victims, who, if included, would total 82% of all rape victims.
28. An American is sexually assaulted every 93 seconds.Sexual assaults are on the rise throughout the whole of the US. On average, state by state comparative analysis (including rape statistics by race data) shows that there are approximately 325,566 victims of rape and sexual assault (age 12 or older) in the US every year.
29. People with disabilities are twice as likely to be victims of rape and sexual assault as those without disabilities.Both males and females with disabilities experienced higher rates of victimization than able-bodied males and females. Surprisingly, rape statistics in the US show that those with a type of cognitive-functioning disability were at higher risk of violent victimization than those with any other type of disability.
30. Girls and women between the ages of 16 and 19 are 4x more likely than girls and women in other age groups to be assaulted or raped.Results gathered from numerous studies show that campus sexual assault statistics have found patterns on the locale of victims. In general, 46% of sexual assault victims were sleeping or performing another activity at home when they were victimized.
Nearly 23% were traveling to and from school or work, shopping, or running errands. Some 19% were working when they were assaulted, 9% were attending school, and 19% were doing some other activity.
31. One out of every six American females is a victim of attempted or completed sexual assault.According to sexual assault facts, one out of every six American women will most probably be the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. This ratio has doubled in the last five years, and analysts predict the same to happen over the course of the next half a decade.
1 in 33 American men (about 3% of the total percentage of women sexually assaulted) have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. This figure has increased by 22.4% over the last five years.
32. For every 1000 rapes in the US, 995 perpetrators will go unpunished.Studies covering unreported sexual assault statistics show that the overwhelming majority of perpetrators will escape punishment of any kind.
US rape stats show that too many victims are afraid to follow through with the legalities of their claim, leading to perpetrators escaping punishment of any form.
Sexual Assault Statistics: The Way AheadAs you can see from the latest stats, the current state of sexual assaults in the US is fairly bad, and current measures do not seem to be working.
So, in addition to increasing awareness of sexual assault dangers, the stigma around sexual assaults needs to be lifted. This will encourage victims to come forward and prosecute attackers and also allow authorities to provide victims with the assistance and help they need in order to heal.
Millions of US women say first sexual experience was rape and New study finds one in 16 women says first sexual experience was forced or coerced in early teens. The first sexual experience for one in 16 US women was forced or coerced intercourse in their early teens, encounters that for some may have had lasting health repercussions, a new study suggests.
The experiences amount to rape, the authors say, although they relied on a national survey that didn‚Äôt use the word in asking women about forced sex.
Almost seven percent of women surveyed said their first sexual intercourse experience was involuntary; it happened at age 15 on average and the man was often several years older.
Nearly half of those women who said intercourse was involuntary said they were held down and slightly more than half of them said they were verbally pressured to have sex against their will.
‚ÄúAny sexual encounter (with penetration) that occurs against somebody‚Äôs will is rape. If somebody is verbally pressured into having sex, it‚Äôs just as much rape,‚Äù said lead author Dr Laura Hawks, an internist and Harvard Medical School researcher.
In the years after coerced or forced sex, affected women had more sex partners, unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and more reproductive health problems including pelvic pain and menstrual irregularities than women whose first sexual experience was not forced.
America Is Largest Drug Cartels In The World and Fentanyl Alone or Fentanyl Laced w-Xylazine To Kill Us is a potent synthetic opioid drug approved by and sold by the Food and Drug Administration for use as an analgesic (pain relief) and anesthetic. It is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin as an analgesic. Illicitly manufactured, fentanyl is added to heroin, disguising it as highly potent heroin, so users don‚Äôt realize that the heroin they‚Äôre purchasing may contain fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that was originally developed as an analgesic ‚Äì or painkiller ‚Äì for surgery. It has a specific chemical structure with multiple areas that can be modified, often illicitly, to form related compounds with marked differences in potency. Fentanyl‚Äôs chemical backbone (the structure in the center) has multiple areas (the colored circles) that can be substituted with different functional groups (the colored boxes around the edges) to change its potency.America Is Largest Drug Cartels In The World and is currently the majority supplier of drug for profit a so called illicit fentanyl to North America, with most, if not all of the cartel's heroin now also being mixed with fentanyl or related chemical like xylazine analogues to increase the heroin's ‚Äúpotency‚Äù in a more cost-effective manner. As of Jan. 2023, the U.S. Government Cartel is overall the most active drug cartel involved in flying in from china etc. and so called smuggling illicit drugs into the United States and trafficking them throughout the country by are own Food and Drug Administration.
Departure of 100 Thousands Private Drug Contractors Was a Turning Point in Afghan Military‚Äôs Collapse and often military veterans who work for drug trade and private security firms. 90% opium-heroin in afganistan area left Afghanistan weeks ago and deployed elsewhere in the region or in the Persian Gulf.
The Afghan troops could still do the basics of ground combat without American private contractors, and they‚Äôd even added some level of skill in repairing military vehicles.
But it was the U.S.-supplied air power that gave Afghan troops their advantage over Taliban fighters, and without on-the-ground maintenance contractors, the military quickly collapsed.

Our Troops Protecting Opium-Heroin - https://rumble.com/v2fg19o-cia-killing-100000-year-selling-heroin-in-u.s.a.-our-troops-protecting-opiu.html - In 1990, a failed CIA anti-drug operation in Venezuela resulted in at least 18 ton of cocaine being smuggled into the United States and sold on the streets. The incident, which was first made public in 1993, was part of a plan to assist an undercover agent to gain the confidence of a Colombian drug cartel.

Own Air Forces fly tons of drugs in and fly guns and arms out to Central America and Sold Tons of Drugs to a San Francisco drug ring and a Los Angeles drug dealer. According to the stories, the CIA and its operatives used crack cocaine--sold via the Los Angeles African-American community--to raise 100s millions dollars to support the agency's clandestine operations in Central America.
Now its very funny again the CIA/FBI Our Government is Sell Drugs Again. The U.S. drug epidemic reached another terrible milestone Wednesday when the government announced that more than 100,000 people had died of overdoses between April 2020 and April 2021. It is the first time that drug-related deaths have reached six figures in any 12-month period. Overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine also increased with are own government help with Mexico and China were the primary source for fentanyl trafficked by our own government and u.s. navy and u.s. air forces flights out of hong kong area into the u.s.a. by land and sea and balloons for years now per the National Center for Health Statistics 2022.
President Biden on Wednesday released a statement mourning the more than 100,000 Americans who died last year from drug overdoses ‚Äî without mentioning U.S.A. and China is helping us with leading role exporting fentanyl, which drove the 29 percent annual increase in deaths but lower then planned.
Nearly two-thirds of deaths were caused by fentanyl and related synthetic opioids that can kill a person at extremely low doses. Fentanyl is increasingly added to non-opioid drugs such as cocaine and counterfeit prescriptions.
In some areas of New York City, including the Bronx and the North Shore of Staten Island, more than 75 percent of overdose deaths involved fentanyl.
‚ÄúToday, new data reveal that our nation has reached a tragic milestone: more than 100,000 lives were lost to the overdose epidemic from April of last year to April of this year,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúAs we continue to make strides to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss, which has touched families and communities across the country‚Äù.

The Los Angeles Department of Public Health has issued a health alert that warns residents of the increased risk of overdose and death associated with xylazine, which is becoming more present among illicit drugs in California. Xylazine is a sedative and muscle relaxant used by veterinarians to anesthetize animals.
Several years after xylazine first began appearing as an additive in illicit street drugs ‚Äï and as its use spreads nationwide ‚Äï the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it will more closely monitor imports.
The agency issued an import alert, which gives it the power to detain raw ingredients or bulk finished product if the shipments are suspected to be in violation of the law.

Lab-Grown And Real Human Meat Was FDA Approved Cannibalism A Sprit Cooking
https://rumble.com/v2mnkmi-lab-grown-and-real-human-meat-was-fda-approved-cannibalism-a-sprit-cooking.html
There is something deeply disquieting about cannibalism. Motives and technicalities do not matter; eating human flesh is now universally considered revolting, whatever the circumstances. However, if we trust a long line of anthropologists and ethnographers, this has not always been the case in all parts of the world and is therefore not self-evident. Stripped of all cultural context and psychological connotations and in purely detached terms, the act of cannibalising a corpse might be considered a victimless crime, the victim of the act being a lifeless body destined to decay anyway. And yet, cannibalism is instinctively perceived in virtually all cultures today as grisly violence and, more than that, a violation of all that makes us human. It is probably this perception that led some scholars to question whether human beings could ever have engaged in such practices, except in the most wretched conditions.

How Americans And World Are Tricked Into Buying Fake Food Learn the Difference ?
https://rumble.com/v2mkfre-how-americans-and-world-are-tricked-into-buying-fake-food-learn-the-differe.html
The food in your kitchen cabinets may not be what it seems. Fraudsters motivated by economic gain secretly infiltrate the global food market through a variety of means, including counterfeits, dilutions, substitution and mislabeling, according to the Global Food Safety Initiative. This may not only harm consumers‚Äô wallets, but it can also put public health and safety at risk. Some estimates say food fraud affects at least 1% of the global food industry at a cost as high as $40 billion a year, according to the FDA. Well, real food is basically any food that is consumed and provides nutritional support and essential nutrients for your body: such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals (It‚Äôs usually of plant or animal origin), while fake food is made in factories with added chemicals and sugars, and is bad for you. It‚Äôs basically food that tastes good but is high in calories having little nutritional value. There‚Äôs a saying stating: If it came from a plant- Eat It. If it was made in a plant- Don't. It‚Äôs that Simple. But even simple rules can be hard to follow. And there‚Äôs clear proof of that from the world we live in today. About 80% of all foods on supermarket shelves didn‚Äôt exist 100 years ago, meaning, a long time ago, when the industrial revolution first started growing more quickly, everyone was excited to see what new foods could be made in factories. And at first, honestly, it wasn‚Äôt that bad‚Ä¶ That is, until everyone started getting used to the new foods. We dropped the organic farm-made fruits and vegetables, we stopped making homemade healthy dishes and we started buying sugary snacks and fast foods. Why? Because it tasted better, it was faster, it saved us time, it was convenient, and it was everywhere. Every corner we look we see a place to eat food, we see fast food restaurants. At every place we scan we see a McDonald‚Äôs, a Pizza Hut and Dunkin Donuts. So this new food that we‚Äôre eating, it‚Äôs convenient and cheap and tastes really good. So doesn‚Äôt that make it good overall? Doesn‚Äôt that make it a positive part of the industrial revolution? Hahahaha‚Ä¶ No. Not at all. Processed foods made in factories have all sorts of chemicals to make them ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. These chemicals make the food last longer and taste tastier. The kinds of chemicals put into fake foods are extremely unhealthy and detrimental to your health and are intended to get you addicted. Oils and sugars are also added to make the food taste better which also leads to addiction. The thing is that when people start, they can‚Äôt stop, and then it only gets worse from there, as seen worldwide.

is underway for many families across metro Atla, and that means summer
break is almost here. But families are struggling to make ends meet, and for them, summertime meals and those progs that help provide assistance are often a way to keep their children from going hungry. Yeah, locally, preparations are already in place for what&#39;s anticipated to be an
increase
in need for those meals. This summer, 11 alives Cares. Belger has the latest details. The Atlanta Community Food Bank has seen a 40% increase in need over the last 18 months. That number is expected to grow once school is out for the summer. Our partners
that provide food for us that needs to be so. Every day, seven days a week, our volunteers come in and help us sort that food, Kenny Hill, the chief
supply chain officer at the Atlanta Community
Food Bank, says. Food insecurity across the statf Georgia has steadily
increased,
and we&#39;re there to try to help stabilize a little bit and fill in the gap, really rely on our donors, our corporate partners
that donate food. Combine that with the recent ped of high gas prices
and the expiration of extended federal SNAP benefi, and he says more families
have turned to the food bank and its partne. For help, the warehouse
packed high today with orders for various
food pantries. Atlanta Community Food Bank CEOe Wade says it&#39;s expensive
to keep things going. We&#39;re spending close to $2,000,000 every month right now just to buy food. And that is up, you know, four times what we were doing prior to the pandemic. Feeding America estimates one in eight Georgia children
are facing hunger. Chris Miner with the Gwinnett
County&#39;s annual summer meals program
can help.
We still think we&#39;ll serve about
100. 1000 meals This year, Miner says the need for ml assistance skyrocketed during te pandemic, then dipped. But it&#39;s rising again. Food security is still a priority in Gwinnett County. Gwinnett County will have 21 sis for free meal distribution over the summer beginning May 31st. That will continue through

The Book of Job is a poetic book found in the Ketuvim section of the Hebrew Bible and is the first of the Poetic Books in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. It addresses theodicy, why God permits evil in the world, through the experiences of the eponymous protagonist, Job, who is a wealthy and God-fearing man with a comfortable life and a large family. The book's theme is the eternal problem of unmerited suffering, and it is named after its central character, Job, who attempts to understand the sufferings that engulf him. The contents of the book, together with its artistic structure and elegant style, place it among the literary masterpieces of all time. Job's prosperity, afflictions, and restoration are recorded in the book.
Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party‚Äôs seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people‚Äôs history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O‚ÄôBrien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood‚Äîthe mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party‚Äôs control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston‚Äôs affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O‚ÄôBrien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O‚ÄôBrien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O‚ÄôBrien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein‚Äôs book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book‚Äîan amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory‚Äîto Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O‚ÄôBrien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O‚ÄôBrien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O‚ÄôBrien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O‚ÄôBrien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O‚ÄôBrien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston‚Äôs head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O‚ÄôBrien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O‚ÄôBrien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother.
America‚Äôs left and right are radicalizing each other, and the precedents from overseas are deeply unsettling. It‚Äôs all politics. And it still is, for those who really listen close. It‚Äôs why we need to flip the script and tell the real story of what happened in 1948 and 1964. I also believe America needs to echo, once again, Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äôs dream and ‚Äúlook to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.‚Äù That‚Äôs what made America great‚Ä¶and will make America great again. It‚Äôs known as ‚ÄúThe Big Switch.‚Äù That‚Äôs when Southern Democrat politicians converted to Republicanism and refashioned the G.O.P. into a racist political party. Orwell's ""1984"" has been quoted left and right, for years, but the reality that we currently live in has never resembled the dystopia that the author describes in his best-known novel as much as it does today. We are voluntarily giving up our privacy. We are forced to use it as a currency. That has never been the case before, but today it is.It is almost impossible to function in today's world without giving up your privacy or rather having it invaded by a corporation or a government. The internet has, clearly, played a huge part in this. It may have brought us closer, but it has also brought governments and corporations closer to us, practically invited them into our homes and minds. ""Both rely on the existence of a technological system with the capacity to monitor every citizen‚Äôs actions and words.‚Äù Meanwhile, governments all over the world, including the United States, are installing more mass surveillance, further invading little what's left of their citizen's privacy. We have been conditioned to feel OK about giving up our privacy (after all, don't they want to ""protect"" us from terrorism?), but governments and corporations use this information in countless ways. For example, Google's and Facebook's sophisticated algorithms are capable of profiling you to such an extent, that serving highly targeted advertisements and propaganda is a fully automated process.
You can even test this yourself -- try looking for something specific to buy and see what type of ads Facebook serves you. Is there any way to combat this? Saying ""I have nothing to hide"" and allowing the government to spy on you is like claiming you have nothing to say and allowing the government to take away your right to freedom of speech.
The 30-something author documented how the Democratic Party‚Äìknown for its historic racism‚Äìsplit in 1948 when Harry S. Truman (D-MO) first ‚Äúintroduced a pro-civil rights platform‚Äù into the Democratic Party. Strom Thurmond (D-SC) and a faction of Southern Democrats, consequently, bolted from Democrats to create the ‚ÄúStates Rights‚Äù (Dixiecrat) party. The author then states these Dixiecrats eventually converted to Republicanism‚Äìalong with Thurmond‚Äìin 1964. Later, Nixon‚Äôs ‚Äúsouthern strategy‚Äù and Reagan‚Äôs conservatism moved the Democratic ‚Äúblue‚Äù South to become a firm ‚Äúred‚Äù Republican in the 1970s and 1980s.
Today, Democrats routinely finger Republicans as ‚Äúracists,‚Äù pointing to occasional neo-Nazi politicians (David Duke, a one-term Louisiana state legislator), obscure racist organizations (Patriot Front) and Confederate flag-waving MAGA types. In fact, just wearing a MAGA hat is considered ‚Äúracist‚Äù by many individuals on the left. It‚Äôs a strong and divisive narrative‚Ä¶but what‚Äôs the TRUTH?
First of all, the ‚ÄúDixiecrats,‚Äù under Strom Thurmond in 1948), did leave the Democratic Party‚Ä¶but for reasons more than racial. The Truman Administration‚Äìfollowing sixteen years of Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äìfurther desired to federalize and centralize government. The Southern Thurmond ‚ÄúDixiecrats‚Äù believed in traditional ‚Äústates‚Äô rights‚Äù and segregation. The Northern and Western Democratic Party in the 1930s and 1940s was more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù politically. President Roosevelt‚Äôs fascination with the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and fascist government programs in Europe guided many of his domestic policies.
Consequently, the 1948 Truman-Democratic platform reflected more centralized and socialist government, thus angering and distancing Southern libertarians. That‚Äôs what really split the Democratic Party in 1948. In fact, in a platform that boasted 4,256 words only 106 (2.4%) were even devoted to civil rights (for the black or anyone else). Even more surprisingly was how the party of slavery, segregation, Ku Klux Klan and Confederate secession was quick to pat itself on the back in 1948. In their summary on civil rights the Democratic Party actually claimed it alone was ‚Äúresponsible for the great civil rights gains‚Äù and committed to ‚Äúcontinuing its efforts to eradicate all racial, religious and economic discrimination.‚Äù
However, such 1940s political posturing is contradicted by a Jim Crow Democratic South that still lynched blacks, refused school, hotel, restaurant, transportation and restroom facilities to ‚Äúcoloreds‚Äù and rigged voting procedures to suppress the black ballot. Therefore, it‚Äôs hard to believe ‚Äúgreat gains‚Äù were actually made by Democrats. Harry Truman was allegedly an inactive participant in the Missouri KKK, and biographers often noted his latent racism against blacks, Jews, Chinese and Japanese throughout his life. Meanwhile Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated a KKK member to the Supreme Court (Hugo Black), put Japanese-Americans into detention camps and refused to welcome black Olympians‚Äîincluding the famed Jesse Owens‚Äîto the White House.
The Dixiecrat exodus was, again, more about progressive, fascist, socialism than segregation and black civil rights. In the end, despite predictions of a Thomas Dewey victory, the Dixiecrat exodus produced little gain. Truman won the ‚Äô48 presidency in a landslide electoral college vote while the Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond mustered an inconsequential 2.4% of the popular vote.
Secondly, the Dixiecrats did NOT convert to Republicanism in 1964 (after Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act) as many historians and journalists now suggest. In fact, most of these racist libertarians returned to the Democratic Party after 1948 and became a significant voting block against civil rights and desegregation throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. According to one historical analysis, of the 1500+ racist ‚ÄúDixiecrats‚Äù only Strom Thurmond and about a dozen others left the Democratic Party for the GOP (less than 1%). Furthermore, Thurmond didn‚Äôt switch parties until 16 years after Truman forced him to create his ‚ÄúDixiecrat‚Äù party.
Thirdly, Southern whites (the people, not the politicians) did vote more REPUBLICAN in post-1965 elections, but not for racial reasons. Again, the Democratic Party was moving left, toward socialism, nonreligious/atheism and adopting liberal planks on abortion, women and gay rights. The Bible Belt South in the 1970s and 1980s became less racist as de-segregation and civil rights laws were enforced. Consequently, immigration to southern cities (Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Nashville, Charlotte) by northern and western GOP conservatives rearranged the voting demographic. Southerners are more conservative and that‚Äôs why dozens of Democrats switched parties. Did you know notable Republicans Trent Lott, Mike Pence, William Bennett and Rick Perry were all previously Democrat? It‚Äôs true. And race was not the reason they switched affiliations‚Ä¶it was due to liberal/socialist policies.
Finally, the Republican Party and its leaders have consistently denounced and resisted the ‚Äúalt right‚Äù ultra-conservative racist organizations. It‚Äôs why these racists formed their own political party in 2009 (The American Freedom Party). Republicans, historically, have always championed civil rights for the black and all ethnicities. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed thanks to widespread Republican support (who had proposed similar legislation in the Eisenhower administration). All Southern Democrats (including those Dixiecrats) voted against it. Oh, and David Duke? He only identified as Republican when politically expedient. Otherwise, he‚Äôs been in the Democrat, Populist or Reformed camp.
Maybe instead of looking at the anomaly of Strom Thurmond, we should investigate the political expediency of another Democrat: Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) who spent 62 years in public office. Byrd served for over half a century at the national level, as a Representative and, later, a powerful Senator. Byrd died in office (2010) at the ripe age of 92. Hillary Clinton called Byrd a ‚Äúfriend and mentor.‚Äù Barack Obama noted how ‚Äúthe arc of his life bent toward justice.‚Äù The press gave him a blessed pass.
That‚Äôs because Robert Byrd proved a quintessential post-WW2 Democrat. Originally a member and leader of the Ku Klux Klan in West Virginia (an affiliation he later disavowed), Byrd refused to fight in World War 2 because it meant serving alongside blacks. He routinely voted with other segregationists in the 1950s. As a senator, Byrd filibustered and voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He abstained his vote for the 1965 Voting Act. He also voted against the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall, the first black Supreme Court justice.
This same Robert Byrd then politically transformed from a known racist to a beloved mentor. How? Simple. He towed the party line‚Ä¶for nearly 57 years! It‚Äôs possible to argue Byrd didn‚Äôt lose his racism but rather, like most good politicians, shelved it. He enjoyed his power and position. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Byrd did what was necessary. In fact, the whole reason Byrd initially joined the KKK was for ‚Äúpolitical power.‚Äù To his credit, he did leave the organization, but still it showed Byrd to be a political opportunist. Once in national office, at least until 1967 (when being a segregationist went out of fashion), he retained his racist roots. Byrd told a reporter: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get that albatross [the KKK] around your neck. Once you‚Äôve made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena.‚Äù
There is a website that I frequent because it puts up a lot of interesting information in fun graphs, infographics and pictures. Information is Beautiful posts a wide range of topics from China‚Äôs censorship to illegal drugs. The following image is from their ‚ÄúLeft vs Right (World)‚Äù post, outlining the basic gist of the left-wing and right-wing political ideologies. There is only so much that you can include in a diagram trying to distinguish the political left from right. This is a generic point to start understanding the main differences between the two sides but we need to keep in mind that there are many degrees of variation on political views (even within the same one). This diagram makes the right-wing way of thinking to be completely cold, calculated and rational, while the left-wing ideas promote more positive views on humanity. While it is true that the right-wing tends to support war, morals and discipline, it should be understood that left-wing can have corruption, discipline and rules.
And what about the people that do not fall strictly into one wing or another? When I was younger and just beginning to learn about political terms and ideas, I was massively confused. What the media taught me was that (I watched a lot of US politics on TV) you are either left or right. There I stood, utterly confused at how I could possibly believe in personal and economic freedom supported by a minimal government role in each aspect. For example, on this graph, I agree with the leftist thought of being progressive and supporting personal freedom. However, I also believe in the right wing ideals of non-interference in society, low taxes, and economic freedom. Yet, I do not believe in organized religion and I fully support gay and abortion rights.
What this diagram shows is that many of us are still stuck in a dichotomous way of thinking, when there are eons of possibilities for a political perspective. Left and right are the most basic division in politics but that should not encourage or pressure people to conform to simply one side or another.
I love Information and is infographics hold a special place in my heart for their ability to effectively convey information in appealing and efficient ways.
In response to the point you make, I agree that we seem to have been protected from the possible existence of ambivalence in political views as if it were some sort of secret. It feels a little strange to say that it is for the public‚Äôs best interest, but that‚Äôs sort of what I‚Äôm arguing.
The left ‚Äì right divide may not so much serve as dichotomous camps that we must choose between, rather they serve as a simplified roadmap to guide the less politically aware public. What will determine where you place yourself will depend on how much weight you give to specific topics. It‚Äôs generally accepted that the citizenship will not know about where they stand on each individual issue, so by using this shortcut they can hopefully make an educated guess that will eventually serve them well.

Secret societies have been in existence all throughout history. Elites, crazed by power and money, band together to exert maximum control over the masses. In 2026 their influence is greater than ever ‚Äì their tentacles reaching all aspects of our daily life through control of the economy, religion, education and politics.
While the world may seem chaotic and confusing to those who are not in the know, those who have studied the history of international secret societies are blessed with an understanding of the evil agenda pushed by the cabal. Why is it a blessing to understand the evil that is in our midst? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to be na√Øve and live with our heads in the sand? No. It is only through understanding this evil that we can fight back and reject the New World Order they are working towards.
The CIA has been conducting mass surveillance in the U.S. with minimal oversight and the program‚Äôs uncovering is bad news for Big Tech ? U.S. Supreme Court Declines to Hear New World Order Challenge to NSA Mass Surveillance. Call on Congress to Limit the NSA‚Äôs Surveillance of Internet Communications.The U.S. Supreme Court today denied the New World Order petition for review of its legal challenge to the National Security Agency‚Äôs (NSA) ‚ÄúUpstream‚Äù surveillance program. Under this program, the NSA systematically searches the contents of internet traffic entering and leaving the United States, including Americans‚Äô private emails, messages, and web communications. The Supreme Court‚Äôs denial leaves in place a divided ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which dismissed New World Order case based on the government‚Äôs assertion of the ‚Äústate secrets privilege.‚Äù
Supreme Court‚Äôs refusal to grant our petition strikes a blow against an individual‚Äôs right to privacy and freedom of expression ‚Äî two cornerstones of our society and the building blocks of New World Order Petition as ‚ÄúWe will continue to champion everyone‚Äôs right to free knowledge, and urge Congress to take on the issue of mass surveillance as it evaluates whether to reauthorize Section 702 later this year.‚Äù
Upstream surveillance is conducted under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which permits the government to intercept Americans‚Äô international communications without a warrant, so long as it is targeting individuals located outside the U.S. for foreign intelligence purposes. Section 702 will expire later this year unless it is reauthorized by Congress.
In the course of this surveillance, both U.S. residents and individuals located outside the U.S. are impacted. The NSA copies and combs through vast amounts of internet traffic, including private data showing what millions of people around the world are browsing online, from communications with friends and family to reading and editing knowledge on projects.
Governments are increasingly purchasing sophisticated technology to monitor their citizens‚Äô behavior on social media. Once the preserve of the world‚Äôs foremost intelligence agencies, this form of mass surveillance has made its way to a range of countries, from major authoritarian powers to smaller or poorer states that nevertheless hope to track dissidents and persecuted minorities. The booming commercial market for social media surveillance has lowered the cost of entry not only for the security services of dictatorships, but also for national and local law enforcement agencies in democracies, where it is being used with little oversight or accountability. Coupled with an alarming rise in the number of countries where social media users have been arrested for their legitimate online activities, the growing employment of social media surveillance threatens to squeeze the space for civic activism on digital platforms.
Social media surveillance refers to the collection and processing of personal data pulled from digital communication platforms, often through automated technology that allows for real-time aggregation, organization, and analysis of large amounts of metadata and content. Broader in scope than spyware, which intercepts communications by targeting specific individuals‚Äô devices, social media surveillance cannot be dismissed as less invasive. Billions of people around the world use these digital platforms to communicate with loved ones, connect with friends and associates, and express their political, social, and religious beliefs. Even when it concerns individuals who seldom interact with such services, the information that is collected, generated, and inferred about them holds tremendous value not only for advertisers, but increasingly for law enforcement and intelligence agencies as well.
Governments have long employed people to monitor speech on social media, including by creating fraudulent accounts to connect with real-life users and gain access to networks. Authorities in Washington dc area have boasted of a 42,000-strong army of sex slave volunteers who monitor online speech. Any citizen can report for duty on the Cyber Police ( AI-NWO) website. Similarly, the ruling Communist Party in China and Russia has recruited thousands of individuals to sift through the internet and report problematic content and accounts to authorities.
The market for social media surveillance has grown, giving intelligence and law enforcement agencies new tools for combing through massive amounts of information. At least 40 of the 65 countries covered by this report have instituted advanced social media monitoring programs. Moreover, their use by governments is accelerating: in 15 of these countries, it was only in the past year that such programs were either expanded or newly established. Justifying their efforts in the name of enhancing security, limiting disinformation, and ensuring public order, governments have effectively co-opted social media platforms. While these platforms typically present themselves as social connectors and community builders, state agencies in repressive countries see them as vast storehouses of speech and personal information that can be observed, collected, and analyzed to detect and suppress dissent.
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up new possibilities for automated mass surveillance. Sophisticated monitoring systems can quickly map users‚Äô relationships through link analysis; assign a meaning or attitude to their social media posts using natural-language processing and sentiment analysis; and infer their past, present, or future locations. Machine learning enables these systems to find patterns that may be invisible to humans, while deep neural networks can identify and suggest whole new categories of patterns for further investigation. Whether accurate or inaccurate, the conclusions made about an individual can have serious repercussions, particularly in countries where one‚Äôs political views, social interactions, sexual orientation, or religious faith can lead to closer scrutiny and outright punishment.
The social media surveillance tools that have appeared in democracies got their start on foreign battlefields and in counterterrorism settings, designed to monitor acute security threats in places like New World Order. Many US data-mining companies received seed money from the Central Intelligence Agency through its In venture capital fund. While authorities in the past typically justified the use of these tools with the need to combat serious crimes such as terrorism, child sexual abuse, and large-scale narcotics trafficking, law enforcement and other agencies at the local, state, and federal levels are increasingly repurposing them for more questionable practices, such as screening travelers for their political views, tracking students‚Äô behavior, or monitoring activists and protesters. This expansion makes oversight of surveillance policies more difficult and raises the risk that constitutionally protected activities will be impaired.
For example, in the United States, agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)‚Äîincluding Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)‚Äîhave used automated technology to collect and analyze personal information, with limited oversight and transparency. By claiming that its power to conduct warrantless searches extends within a 100-mile radius of any US border, DHS has effectively asserted extrajudicial surveillance powers over 200 million people. CBP has even purchased technology from Cellebrite, an Israeli company, to bypass encryption and passwords and enable quick extraction of data from phones and computers, including social media content. There has been a spike in device searches at the borders in recent years; the number of such searches, normally limited under the Fourth Amendment of the constitution, increased by 292 percent, from 8,503 to 33,295, between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2018. Over that same period, inbound travel to the United States increased by less than 3 percent.
These searches have become part of the government‚Äôs drive toward big data surveillance. The resulting information is frequently deposited in massive multiagency databases where it can be combined with public records, secret intelligence materials, and datasets (including social media data) assembled by private companies. In one case, ICE paid the data analytics company Palantir $42.3 million for a one-year contract related to FALCON, a custom-built database management tool. Its ‚ÄúSearch and Analysis System‚Äù enables agents to analyze trends and establish links between individuals based on information gathered during border searches, purchased from private data brokers, and obtained from other intelligence collection exercises. Similar tools developed by Palantir are used by some 300 police departments in the state of California alone, as well as by police forces in Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York City. Many of these programs are facilitated through DHS and its Regional Intelligence Centers.
The chilling effect on free expression caused by increased surveillance is well documented. Activists and journalists who might otherwise hold governments to account for wrongdoing are more inclined to self-censor, while dissidents and members of marginalized communities will think twice about discussing their political opinions online to avoid arrests or travel restrictions. Furthermore, social media monitoring designed to quell mobilization and identify protesters hinders the public‚Äôs ability to use online tools to associate and assemble peacefully. Finally, indiscriminate monitoring of the general population‚Äôs online communications‚Äîeven when those communications are nominally public‚Äîruns afoul of due process standards enshrined in democratic constitutions and international human rights law.
There is little if any public evidence that such technology is more effective than less-invasive alternatives for ensuring national security and combating serious crimes. Social media activity such as original content, likes, or shares‚Äîparticularly speech that is rendered in slang or languages other than English‚Äîis susceptible to misinterpretation and misclassification. Research has estimated the accuracy rates of natural-language processing tools at 70 to 80 percent. While they are often justified as a means to reduce human error, algorithmic tools can further entrench racial or religious discrimination due to reliance on inaccurate or biased data. The resulting false positives can add innocent people to government watch lists, often without their knowledge, leaving them with little recourse for remedying the mistake.
At the very least, social media surveillance must come under greater oversight. The use of such programs must be transparent, including sustained dialogue between law enforcement and affected communities. Public civil rights assessments should be conducted, and authorities should be held accountable when tools are misused and offer remedies for any victims. Online surveillance technology should not be used to proactively monitor the planning and organization of peaceful protest activities or individuals‚Äô involvement in nonviolent political groups. And governments should swiftly amend existing privacy legislation to address the proper use of this technology.
Thanks to the development of AI-assisted tools, governments now have a greater capacity for surveillance than ever before. Given their potential impact on fundamental rights, policymakers and citizens must ask themselves whether these new tools are necessary or desirable in a democratic society. It is time to move beyond outdated arguments that individuals ‚Äúshould have nothing to hide‚Äù or do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in public areas. The survival of democracy requires vibrant public spaces, both offline and online, where individuals can collaborate, organize, and go about their personal lives without fear of constant surveillance.

What Orwell‚Äôs ‚Äò1984‚Äô tells us about today‚Äôs world, 70 years after it was published Seventy years ago, Eric Blair, writing under a pseudonym George Orwell, published ‚Äú1984,‚Äù now generally considered a classic of dystopian fiction.
The novel tells the story of Winston Smith, a hapless middle-aged bureaucrat who lives in Oceania, where he is governed by constant surveillance. Even though there are no laws, there is a police force, the ‚ÄúThought Police,‚Äù and the constant reminders, on posters, that ‚ÄúBig Brother Is Watching You.‚Äù
Smith works at the Ministry of Truth, and his job is to rewrite the reports in newspapers of the past to conform with the present reality. Smith lives in a constant state of uncertainty; he is not sure the year is in fact 1984.
Although the official account is that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia, Smith is quite sure he remembers that just a few years ago they had been at war with Eastasia, who has now been proclaimed their constant and loyal ally. The society portrayed in ‚Äú1984‚Äù is one in which social control is exercised through disinformation and surveillance.
As a scholar of television and screen culture, I argue that the techniques and technologies described in the novel are very much present in today‚Äôs world.
‚Äò1984‚Äô as historyOne of the key technologies of surveillance in the novel is the ‚Äútelescreen,‚Äù a device very much like our own television.
The telescreen displays a single channel of news, propaganda and wellness programming. It differs from our own television in two crucial respects: It is impossible to turn off and the screen also watches its viewers.
The telescreen is television and surveillance camera in one. In the novel, the character Smith is never sure if he is being actively monitored through the telescreen. Orwell‚Äôs telescreen was based in the technologies of television pioneered prior to World War II and could hardly be seen as science fiction. In the 1930s Germany had a working videophone system in place, and television programs were already being broadcast in parts of the United States, Great Britain and France.
Past, present and futureThe dominant reading of ‚Äú1984‚Äù has been that it was a dire prediction of what could be. In the words of Italian essayist Umberto Eco, ‚Äúat least three-quarters of what Orwell narrates is not negative utopia, but history.‚Äù
Additionally, scholars have also remarked how clearly ‚Äú1984‚Äù describes the present.
In 1949, when the novel was written, Americans watched on average four and a half hours of television a day; in 2009, almost twice that. In 2017, television watching was slightly down, to eight hours, more time than we spent asleep.
In the U.S. the information transmitted over television screens came to constitute a dominant portion of people‚Äôs social and psychological lives.
‚Äò1984‚Äô as present dayIn the year 1984, however, there was much self-congratulatory coverage in the U.S. that the dystopia of the novel had not been realized. But media studies scholar Mark Miller argued how the famous slogan from the book, ‚ÄúBig Brother Is Watching You‚Äù had been turned to ‚ÄúBig Brother is you, watching‚Äù television.
Miller argued that television in the United States teaches a different kind of conformity than that portrayed in the novel. In the novel, the telescreen is used to produce conformity to the Party. In Miller‚Äôs argument, television produces conformity to a system of rapacious consumption ‚Äì through advertising as well as a focus on the rich and famous. It also promotes endless productivity, through messages regarding the meaning of success and the virtues of hard work.
Many viewers conform by measuring themselves against what they see on television, such as dress, relationships and conduct. In Miller‚Äôs words, television has ‚Äúset the standard of habitual self-scrutiny.‚Äù
The kind of paranoid worry possessed by Smith in the novel ‚Äì that any false move or false thought will bring the thought police ‚Äì instead manifests in television viewers that Miller describes as an ‚Äúinert watchfulness.‚Äù In other words, viewers watch themselves to make sure they conform to those others they see on the screen.
This inert watchfulness can exist because television allows viewers to watch strangers without being seen. Scholar Joshua Meyrowitz has shown that the kinds of programming which dominate U.S television ‚Äì news, sitcoms, dramas ‚Äì have normalized looking into the private lives of others.
Controlling behaviorAlongside the steady rise of ‚Äúreality TV,‚Äù beginning in the ‚Äò60s with ‚ÄúCandid Camera,‚Äù ‚ÄúAn American Family,‚Äù ‚ÄúReal People,‚Äù ‚ÄúCops‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Real World,‚Äù television has also contributed to the acceptance of a kind of video surveillance.
For example, it might seem just clever marketing that one of the longest-running and most popular reality television shows in the world is entitled ‚ÄúBig Brother.‚Äù The show‚Äôs nod to the novel invokes the kind of benevolent surveillance that ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù was meant to signify: ‚ÄúWe are watching you and we will take care of you.‚Äù
But Big Brother, as a reality show, is also an experiment in controlling and modifying behavior. By asking participants to put their private lives on display, shows such as ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù encourage self-scrutiny and behaving according to perceived social norms or roles that challenge those perceived norms.
The stress of performing 24/7 on ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù has led the show to employ a team of psychologists.
Television scholar Anna McCarthy and others have shown that the origins of reality television can be traced back to social psychology and behavioral experiments in the aftermath of World War II, which were designed to better control people.
Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram, for example, was influenced by ‚ÄúCandid Camera.‚Äù
In the ‚ÄúCandid Camera‚Äù show, cameras were concealed in places where they could film people in unusual situations. Milgram was fascinated with ‚ÄúCandid Camera,‚Äù and he used a similar model for his experiments ‚Äì his participants were not aware that they were being watched or that it was part of an experiment.
Like many others in the aftermath of World War II, Milgram was interested in what could compel large numbers of people to ‚Äúfollow orders‚Äù and participate in genocidal acts. His ‚Äúobedience experiments‚Äù found that a high proportion of participants obeyed instructions from an established authority figure to harm another person, even if reluctantly.
While contemporary reality TV shows do not order participants to directly harm each other, they are often set up as a small-scale social experiment that often involves intense competition or even cruelty.
Surveillance in daily lifeAnd, just like in the novel, ubiquitous video surveillance is already here.
Closed-circuit television exist in virtually every area of American life, from transportation hubs and networks, to schools, supermarkets, hospitals and public sidewalks, not to mention law enforcement officers and their vehicles.
Surveillance footage from these cameras is repurposed as the raw material of television, mostly in the news but also in shows like ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Most Wanted,‚Äù ‚ÄúRight This Minute‚Äù and others. Many viewers unquestioningly accept this practice as legitimate.
The friendly face of surveillanceReality television is the friendly face of surveillance. It helps viewers think that surveillance happens only to those who choose it or to those who are criminals. In fact, it is part of a culture of widespread television use, which has brought about what Norwegian criminologist Thomas Mathiesen called the ‚Äúviewer society‚Äù ‚Äì in which the many watch the few.
For Mathiesen, the viewer society is merely the other side of the surveillance society ‚Äì described so aptly in Orwell‚Äôs novel ‚Äì where a few watch the many.
Religious beliefs shape the world around us, motivating good deeds but also fueling conflict.

Their mission is to fight hunger by engaging, educating and empowering our community. They've worked with more than 700 nonprofit partners to distribute over 65 million meals across Metro Atlanta and North Georgia.

Every month they receive nearly 9 million pounds of donated food and grocery products, 22% of which is fresh produce. These donated goods come from individuals and the local food industries, including manufacturers, distributors, farmers and retailers. They then distribute the food to more than 700 nonprofit partner agencies who operate food assistance programs in 29 North Georgia counties.

I'm looking forward to seeing their growth with continuing to resolve issues with hunger in Atlanta and Fulton County.

Every dollar you donate goes a long way to feeding families in need.,"The Atlanta Community Food Bank is on a mission to end hunger in the Atlanta area through more than just food. Their goal is to get to the root of hunger and food insecurity by engaging, educating, and empowering our community. President and CEO Kyle Wade has more. When we talk about food insecurity, we&#39;re really talking about a family. A household not having all of the resources they need to meet all of their basic needs. Which means that from time to time, they&#39;re not going to know where their next meal is going to come from, and they&#39;re going to need help from resources like the food bank to meet those basic needs. The Atlantic Community Food Bank is one of the largest hunger relief organizations in the country. We&#39;re really a large food distributor, but our mission is to engage, educate and empower the community to fight hunger. And what&#39;s interesting about that mission is even though we&#39;re a large food. Contributor there&#39;s nothing in that mission statement that says anything about trucks or warehouses or forklifts or even food. It&#39;s all about how we are bringing the community together, giving the Community knowledge and information, tools and resources so that all of us can make a difference in building a better community and ensuring all of our neighbors have the food that they need. So when we talk about engaging and empowering the community. That plays itself out in a couple of different ways. So it starts with this incredible network of partners that we&#39;ve built over 40 plus years. These community based organizations that work with us to feed people in their local communities. We&#39;ve invested resources in addition to all the food that we distribute to help those organizations have more capacity to serve their local communities. We have an amazing resource with the food. Bank providing an unbelievable, almost seems like a never ending source of food we. Know that we have one of the best food banks in the country and that allows us to grow and to think strategically about how we can use a Co-op in a community to provide food security. And so finding the right locations and partners and even one of the people I met while filming this is a possible partner for us to think about having a coop that creates community and using food to bring people together. The Food Bank is a pretty substantial regional nonprofit organization we have. Close to 200 staff members here at the food Bank who are just we we like to say we have the greatest food bankers in the world right here in Atlanta, GA we&#39;ve got a tremendous group of people working in a variety of roles across our organization. When I first got with the food bank, I worked as as a as a person in the the warehouse picking orders and just seeing the importance on that level as far as like if this stuff that doesn&#39;t get out then people. Don&#39;t don&#39;t eat working long hours during during COVID at at the height of the pandemic. Just seeing how you know this stuff really does a does affect people and during that time people losing their jobs and not knowing where they were going to get food from and the land of Community Food Bank was that beacon of hope to ensure that that people got food. There&#39;s a lot of ways you can get involved in our work. It all starts with going to our website acfb.org. There you can quickly. Find out how you can volunteer. You can sign up for a volunteer shift. We&#39;ll engage close to 30,000 volunteers over the course of the year. We accept volunteers as young as age 8. You can also at our website. Find out how you can locate a food pantry near you. Certainly that means you can help people you know who might need help get that help, but it&#39;s also a way for you to connect with that local organization and maybe get involved in their work. You can make a financial donation to the Food bank at our website. It&#39;s really fast, and every dollar you donate helps us provide up to four. Deals to people in need, so go to our website, acfb.org and there are a lot of ways you can quickly get involved to make a difference. Any donation helps the Atlanta Community Food bank battle food insecurity in our area. It&#39;s so easy to donate. Just head to acfb.org and thank you to the Atlanta Community Food Bank for sponsoring this Atlanta and company plus.

Covid-19 News: October 21, 2022
On Wednesday, the CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to make Covid shots part of the childhood immunization schedule. The CDC, which always follows the ACIP‚Äôs advice, will almost certainly move forward with updating the schedule. Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo reaffirmed his recommendation against healthy children receiving experimental Covid shots.
Dr.s Rejecting 'CDC's 'Covid-19' Shots Becoming Part Of Childhood Vaccination ScheduleIn this interview with The New American, Dr. Ladapo argued that at this point in the pandemic, when an overwhelming majority of children have contracted Covid and considering the lack of long-term safety data on the shots and available data on adverse reactions, the risks far outweigh the benefits for this cohort.
The surgeon general explained that if the CDC updates the recommendation, it would pave the way for the state healthcare authorities to include Covid shots in mandated immunization schedules. That means that to attend public or private school, children would need to get inoculated against Covid. Since the majority of parents are clearly not enthusiastic about vaccinating their children against Covid, they can and should influence the local authorities not to mandate the shots, or file for legal exemptions.

NEW 'COVID-19' DEVELOPMENTS FOUND IN 'UKRAINE' LEADS TO A MAJOR NARRATIVE SHIFT
reports on the recent news that in November of 2019, nearly 2 months before ""SarsCoV2"" was known to exist (not that it actually does), the US was studying it in Ukraine. At least according to recently acquired paperwork.Meanwhile, the foreknowledge is obvious as the vaccines seemed ready to go on January 25th of 2020, one day after the Chinese government locked down.Now, countless studies are coming out showing the dramatic dangers of the vaccine which is killing massive numbers of people.Pfizer just admitted they never tested the vaccine on ""transmission"" despite claiming in their fraudulent campaign that people need to get vaccinated to save ""other people.""All the while, a top French politician who recently was vaccine injured came out and claimed that Emanuel Macron never got the vaccine despite his horrific crackdown on his own people.
In this video, we break down the complete insanity of the most recent vaccine related news.

Dr. 'Robert Malone' WARNS Something Strange Is Happening Worldwide, Tearing Our Movement Apart
Dr. 'Robert Malone' Something Strange Happening Worldwide. It's Trying to Tear Our Movement Apart.
Have you noticed something strange going on lately within the health freedom movement? You're not alone.
At the highly anticipated Toronto premier of the film 'Uninformed Consent' on Saturday (Oct. 8), Dr. Robert Malone warned of a concerted effort to divide us, and that to some extent‚Äîit's working.
""There is an effort right now, as the truth is coming out, to destroy the integrity and cohesion of the resistance groups all across the world... do not let them put us in opposition with each other, we must stand together as community,"" warned Dr. Malone.
You wouldn‚Äôt call you controlled opposition if you didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúWe should only give this vaccine to the elderly and the most vulnerable‚Äù‚Ä¶then at the same time say, ‚ÄúThis vaccine is a depopulation bioweapon.‚Äù
I Don't fully trust Dr. Malone. He is playing both sides

Not all truth advocates have figured out the same psyops yet but here's some of my research since 2007:
we will hold them accountable:https://rumble.com/v1husu5-dr.-mary-holland-and-attorney-reiner-fuellmich-at-the-75th-anniversary-of-t.html
You may want to speak to the 18 scientists, Dr. Poornima Wagh and her colleagues, conducting various types of analysis on the different manufacturers' actual vials/lots of the COVID19 injections because they have not found any mRNA or spike proteins in the over 2300 samples they've tested.
What they have found is ""massive quantities of toxic heavy metals"". The COVID19 injections are chemical weapons, not bioweapons.
There has never been an actual isolated virus found. Dr. Wagh asked for samples of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 virus from multiple organizations such as the CDC and they don't have them.

Covid"" is blamed for escalating sickness/death in caused by vaccinations. Mainstream censure, lie, stonewall and cover up. Mass psychosis and deception rule. Many symptoms of covid/vaccines are identical to venom poisoning and treatment for such is effective. See the Italian study ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Med-scientists find venomous ""organoids"" in undiluted vaccines. The ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the vaccines cause breakdown of organs and immune system (cf ADE) ‚Äì thus emergent chronic illness - ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù - fatigue, infertility, miscarriages (data - 75% of pregnancies) cancers, diabetes, heart damage, blood clotting, white string (metallic) clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., death - sudden in adults and children. Med-scientists have discovered toxic metals including graphene oxide in every vaccine - cf hydrogel nano technology; https://www.bitchute.com/video/OILW74CXzdjO/ . Mrna nano particles vaccine delivery cause permanent systemic organ damage and dna alteration. Covid a virus? Many high level Dr‚Äôs (cf. Dr Mike Yeadon) now state there are no respiratory viruses - viruses non existant. Synthetic venom is transmitted via physical contact, water, air & vaccine spike protein. Vaccines, masks, mandates and bogus pcr tests drive ""covid"". There is strong med-science agreement that Covid and vaccination are bioweapons. Vaccines cause the body to be a venomated spike protein factory. The more vaxx shots the more toxic spike protein invades - shed to the unvaccinated via breath and physical contact ‚Äì may be eliminated by a healthy immune system - see immune system boost supplements protocols - FLCCC, Dr Ardis (cf nicotine), Dr Zelenko, Dr Love and ors ‚Äì (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water). Read the Bible about eternal life.
Sars, Covi2,There's absolutely NO hope for those who will continue to get boosted. It doesn't matter how many research papers, testimonies, etc. you show them as they don't seem to possess any reasoning any more. Just let them have them and save your energy in saving those who can be saved. Those states and provinces that have the highest vax rate will continue to do what they HAD been doing, and those of us who had doubted this from the start will continue to resist it.
FDA and CDC need to be disbanded
Yes, new proof out of Germany: https://rumble.com/v1jodlh-toxic-substances-found-in-covid-vaccines-without-exception-new-german-study.html
Help us stop mandates and stop the shots: https://www.fastestlabs.com/glendale/other-testing-services/specialty-testing/
the CDC,NIH,,& the FDA are continually rejecting any facts that any World Class Medical experts present to us. So shut up peasants, & get your periodical boosters.
Covid vaccines, viruses, mrna and spike protein discussion MAY now be obsolete.HIGH level med-scientists/doctors (incl Dr Wagh Phdx2 - virology and immunology, Dr Yeadon, Dr Merritt, Dr Cahill & ors) state, that there are no respiratory viruses - viruses are non existent - cf Dr‚Äôs Sam & Mark Bailey & ors) . And all toxshots are chemical weapons - no virus, no mrna and no spike protein. Bogus PCR & face diapers do nothing but cause harm. ONE: Med-scientists have found a ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the toxshots. See Italian study: ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Synthetic venom is easily dispersed in water, air, food & toxshots/boosters. TWO: Med-scientists have found much toxic heavy metals including reduced graphene oxide in every toxshot/booster no matter what brand (2300+ tested- 20+ scientists in universities/labs world wide), and along with nano hydrogel particles = systemic inflammation, organ and neurological damage- blood clotting etc. THUS: synthetic venom + toxshots graphene oxide + heavy metal toxicity (+ 5G) = emergent chronic illnesses - ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù, fatigue, infertility, miscarriages, cancers, diabetes, heart damage ‚Äì myocarditis etc, blood clotting, string clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, neurological problems, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., immune system failure, death - sudden in adults and children. Unvaxxed get similar sicknesses by transmitting of graphene oxide through breath and skin - cf the blood of unvaxxed children living with vaxxed parents have graphene oxide assembling the in their blood (Dr Hoffe and ors). TO DETOX- immune system supplements - FLCCC, Dr Ardis, Dr Zelenko, Dr Love, Dr Merritt and ors‚Äì (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water).

The FDA tried to ban glutathione from medical use in June 2022 because it's natural and it works on numerous illnesses, and of course, word is getting out that it prevents viruses. Smart doctors stopped the committee from banning it.

US and Taiwan to launch formal trade talks in fall | DW News
The United States and Taiwan have announced plans to start trade talks in the fall. Taipei says it wants to attract more US investment and join international trade blocs, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The announcement comes amid rising tensions with China. A recent visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island democracy drew sharp criticism from Beijing. Taiwan is the United States‚Äô eighth-largest trading partner delivering semiconductors and many other technologies.

Gaurav Sawant Reaches Taiwan Amidst Tense Situation Over China's War Mongering
China on Wednesday repeated military threats against Taiwan while appearing to wind down wargames near the self-governing island it claims as its own territory that have raised tensions between the two sides to their highest level in years.
The message in a lengthy policy statement issued by the Cabinet‚Äôs Taiwan Affairs Office and its news department followed almost a week of missile firings and incursions into Taiwanese waters and airspace by Chinese warships and air force planes.
The actions disrupted flights and shipping in a region crucial to global supply chains, prompting strong condemnation from the U.S., Japan and others.

Taiwan has condmned China for extending military drills off its coast into a fifth day. Taipei also accused Beijing of trying to deliberately provoke a reaction from it. The condemnation followed China's decision to defy calls to end its biggest-ever show of force against the self-governing island.Chinese jets and ships have been crossing the Taiwan Strait median line and firing missiles over Taipei. The drills began last week, after a visit to Taiwan by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Beijing considers Taiwan its own territory.

Washington has accused Beijing of 'irresponsible' actions following its air and sea military drills around Taiwan.

And I said, Why?He said, ""Because of the ditch sticks in Ottawa.""Now, I will never tell that joke becauseI can't repeat it, but it underlines the truth.You want a Prime Minister whoknows what they're talking about?Leslie Lewis has degrees in everythingfrom energy policy, environmental policy, businessadministration, a doctorate in law.Folks, she is the most learned person on this tourin this race, and more so than the Prime Minister.And she doesn't brag about it.She just takes what she's learned and puts it to work.And we like that about her talkabout putting things to work. Again,I don't begrudge the fact that our Prime Ministerlives in luxury and never really had to workfor it. We really worked hard for it.Here we have a woman who knows what it is tobuild a business from the start, knows what it is tohave to meet payroll for families who will go hungry ifthe business isn't successful, to get up early every morning andgo to bed late at night wanting to make that payroll.Folks, when we talk, when you hear a PrimeMinister who says that business people, especially small businesspeople, are just in it so they can hidetheir taxes? Unfortunately, we can't hide our taxes.He takes most of them.But here's a woman who's paid her taxes and paidher dues and did it the hard and honest way.Isn't that what you'd like tosee in the Prime Minister's office?Some people have even said, is she tough enough?Is she tough enough?Leslie, I think you've been running thatlaw firm for just under 20 years.I think, folks, picture this.How would you like to get up everymorning and go to work and work witha bunch of hungry lawyers every single day?That builds toughness.We've got a woman here who understands that.We also have a woman here who isa woman of faith and is not afraid,when she's asked about that faith, to speak about it.Don't you want somebody like that in Ottawa?She respects all faiths, but she also saysthat your faith should be respected, too.Ladies and gentlemen, it's officially MP Dr.Leslin Lewis. But she tells us we can call her Leslyn.Ladies and gentlemen, would you give a hand withyour help for the next Prime Minister of Canada?Dr. MP Leslyn Lewis!I had to get that offered.You'd say I wasn't tough enough, soI made sure I pulled it off.This is great.What an introduction!With an introduction like that, I don't evenneed to really say much about myself.So I'm just going to delve right into it.And I'm going to leave some time for questionsbecause I want to hear what's on your heartand I'm going to do what politicians don't do.I'm going to answer your questions.So I've been traveling around the country, and thequestion that I'm asked all the time is, whyare you going to do this again?You entered the race in 2020, andhere you are doing it again.And the truth is the reason why I enteredthe race in 2020, so many of those reasonsare still there, but now they are magnified.The fabric of our nation is being torn apart.Provinces like Alberta are still threateningto leave our great Confederation.Debt is piling up to the tuneof $1.2 trillion every single day.We pay interest payments, interestpayments of $140,000,000 a day.How many of you have watched Oprah?Do you know about Oprah?Do you remember that mean that she haswhen she gives a car to everybody?Well, I'm telling you, you owe 31,000, youowe 31,000, you owe 31,000, you owe 31,000.And all of your children havetheir share of debt of 31,000.And this is before they even enter the workforce.Think of what we have done to future generations.We have saddled future generations with debt.We need to turn things around.We need to create hope for future generations.And I believe that I'm the person thatcan restore hope and prosperity to this nation.The social divides have been sowide in the last two years.I am speaking to people, and when I hear theirstories, you can see the trauma that Canadians have endured.And the biggest manifestation of thatwas seen through the Trucker Convoy.Now, I don't know where you standon that issue, and it doesn't matter.What we saw happen is symbolicof a fracture in our democracy.I lived one block away from wherethe truckers parked in front of Parliament.And watching the news, I can tell you that thefirst day I had to walk through, I didn't knowwhat I was going to expect because the news, thecoverage was like our country was under siege.There were acts of sedition being committed.These people were.And so when I walked through, I said, no, I'm goingto stop and I'm going to listen and I'm going totalk to these Canadians because they are paying my salary.And it felt good to have asalary that someone else would pay.Usually I would say my own salary as a lawyer.So these Canadians are paying my salary andI am not going to listen to them.I said no, and I stoppedand I had conversations with them.And I believe that that was a missedopportunity on behalf of our Prime Minister.These were hardworking Canadians who werelabeled as misogynist, racist, demonized.And this is what we have done with Cancel Culture.We have erased what makes us truly Canadian.When I was growing up in this country, youwere taught to be proud of your country.You were taught that your Canadian identity issomething that is envied around the world.We were once the beacon of hope,of opportunity for everyone around the world.And now in our schools, our childrenare taught to erase their history.I'm not saying that we have a perfect country.We don't, and we've made mistakes, but we can learnfrom our mistakes and we can build on that.And if we erase our history, if we erase our heroes,we are doomed to make the same mistakes in the future.Now I'm going to talk to you alittle bit about the 2020 leadership race.Sometimes I would walk in aroom and people would laugh.At the beginning, people thought, whodoes she think she is?She's not even going to get any votes.And I said to myself, I knew thatI had a calling to enter politics.And I knew when I saw Andrew Scheerrunning from reporters because he didn't want totalk about being prolife, I said, there's arole and I'm going to enter politics.And I'm going to let everybody know I'm aperson of faith and I am pro-life.And that I can tell you courage becomes contagious.People were starting to say that's okay, evenif someone is pro-choice, we can have conversations.When I entered politics, when I ran for theleadership, it was always: that debate was over.And I would say, no.Any debate in the democracy should be open.That's what a democracy is.It's a plurality of voices.And we can each have our own opinion onsomething and still find something that we agree to.So I eventually won the popular vote.I got more votes than all of the other politicians.And I wasn't even an MP at that time.And I did that by buildingbridges, even something like pro-life.I said, what do we agree on?Do we agree that pregnancy care centers should bethere for women who make choices, that they mayfind themselves in a situation where they have anunwanted pregnancy and they may do something so compassionateis saying, I'm going to give this child upfor adoption to a loving family.When our adoptions list are so long in this country, shouldwe not be there for women who make those choices?And guess what?The majority of Canadians agree with that.So here we have some commonality.And I believe that the next leader of thiscountry should be a bridge builder, and I amthat person that can build those bridges.I think it's so important that we aspire tomake sure that our children have a future.I am running to be that hope.When I think of the fact that theaverage home in this country is $1.1 million.I think of the young people who have their future.They may never own a home because ofout of control inflation and the un-affordability of ever beingable to secure that down payment.I want to bring back hope to them.I want to make sure that when they graduate, they'renot competing with their fathers and their uncles and theiraunts for their jobs, that we have a system ofcreating wealth, that we incentivize businesses to one day takea chance again so that those small businesses who employover 80% of all Canadians will take a chance andemploy our youth and create opportunities for them.I'm here for the nurse who told me that sheworked throughout COVID without any vaccine, and she got Covid.And even she had to rent a trailer on herlawn to make sure that her family was protected.And she worked double shifts andshe slept out in that trailer.And then after the vaccines came out, they fired her.They told her that she could not have a job anymore.And she told me that when she looked inthe mirror in the evening after her shifts, shehad indentations in her face from the mask.And these are the sacrificesthat some people have made.And we have to make sure thatwhen we put policies in place, thesehealth policies are there to protect people.They're not based on political science.They're based on real science and make sure thatpeople are protected and that we do not createa system of segregation based on vaccine status.I'm here for people of faith to makethem recognize that they have a right topractice their faith, and that faith is entrenchedin our Constitution, in our Charter of Rights.I want to make sure that every parentin this room knows that they have aright to raise their children in accordance withtheir values without government interference.As I said before, I don't know where you stand onthe Trucker Convoy, but what I can tell you is thatthe coverage of it erodes our trust in the media.When we heard about acts of sedition, and lateron, we saw that only charges of mischief werelaid that undermines the trust in our institutions.When the Emergencies Act was enacted, was utilized toconfiscate people's property, to freeze bank accounts, it erodesour trust in the institution of government, and wemust work to restore that trust.I had a young woman in my riding of Haldimand-Norfolk,which for those of you who don't know,it's a rural community right beside Niagara Falls.And this young single mother had bought a truckerT-shirt for her daughter because she reallywanted one, and her bank account was frozen.She couldn't pay her bills. She had nofood. And this was a $20 T-shirt.When our government acts in such amanner, it really erodes our confidence.And I've had people report to me that they arethinking about even leaving our country, this beautiful country, becauseof the lack of trust in our democracy.We need to make sure that the nextleader rebuilds that trust in our institution.And one way of doing that is to makesure that our media is no longer an armof the Liberal government and to make sure thatour media is no longer used as a propagandatool, because that is what happens in dictatorship regimes.As you can see, I'm not your usual politician.I come from industry.I've taught at university.I've taught at Osgood Hall Law School.And I've owned my own business.So I know what it means to sign the frontof a paycheck rather than the back of a paycheck.I know what it means to create wealth.I know what it means to look at that two weekperiod and say, how am I going to make payroll?I know what it means in 2009 when therecession was coming and I had to make surethat my employees got paid before me.And I had to make sure that I use the lineof credit on my home to keep their jobs alive becauseI knew that they had families that were dependent on me,making sure that I give them a paycheck.So I know the realities of what it takesto create wealth, to create prosperity in this country.And right now, I see international pressures beingput on this country that will change theface of what we are as Canadians.It will change the face of ourmeritorious society to become a socialistnation state that Justin Trudeau envisions.I'm here to fight against that.So I made the tough decision thatI thought actually I could have both.I thought I could have my law practiceand be a politician because I trained lawyers.There were lawyers in my law firm.But as many of you know who haveor if you know somebody who is asmall business owner, your business becomes your brand.And many people, they still wanted to hear from me.They still wanted me to work on their case.And so I had to make a decision to sell myfirm and even the building that my law firm was in.I owned the units in that building and I sold it becauseI did not want to be double minded in doing this.I wanted to give every fiber of my being to savingmy country because I know that my country is in peril.My dream for Canada is that we can bringback a Canada where we could have a diversityof opinions, where we are not afraid to showthat we are people of faith or someone.If you're not of faith, that you havethe equal right to raise your children inaccordance with your values and practice your faithwhere we can have a dream of prosperingdeveloping our natural resources while protecting the environment.Every day we import over 500,000 barrels of oil a day.Yet we have the third largestaccessible oil reserves on the planet.We have the capacity to be self-sufficient During Covid,we should not have had to depend onforeign countries to send us masks and gloves.We have the capacity toproduce those products ourselves.We need to bring our supply chains home.We need to start producing more than we'reconsuming, and we need to become an independentand self sustaining and free nation.Thank you.Very good. Thank you very much. Dr. Lewis.We now want to enter asession of questions and answers.I'm sure a lot of you have burning questionson your heart that you'd like to ask Dr.Lewis, and I'm sure she'd be happy to answer them.So I know a lot of you probably have questions,so I will be moderating this Q and A.Please just raise your hand.Hopefully you'll have a chanceto get your question asked.And if you don't get a chance, then youwill have an opportunity to meet her afterwards andhopefully be able to ask her question in person.So without further Ado, we'll juststart with this individual right here.Happy two.Doctor Lewis, we're so excited you're running again.In the current world and procedures for the leadership race. As everyelectoral district will be allocated 100 points.At that stage, whichever is less.I think this change is really going to help you.Can you comment on that?Yes, that's a great question.So I'm just going to repeat the question.Every electoral district is allocated 100points or one point per vote.In the last leadership race, it didn't work like that.So if there were 5000 people in a riding and 20people in another, even if I won the riding with 5000people, I would only get 100 votes and the person whowon with 20 people would still get 100 votes.Now things will change.The 5000 member riding will get 100 votes, butthe one with 20 will only get 20 votes.So what happened is in the last leadershiprate, I won the popular vote, but Ididn't win the leadership because of that allocation.So this gentleman is right that thenew rules will benefit me more.But are you running to be the leader ofthe opposition with this attendant perks or the PM?One entails preaching to the choir, and I'm one ofthe members and a few other members are here.The other involves going out to anation waiting for the good news.Now, I believe, and I'm one of themas well, like yourself, an immigrant, I thinkthere are a lot of unreached natural Conservatives.So unless you or whoever is going to be theleader of the party reaches them and not just thechoir, and I understand you need to reach the choirto be the nominee but unless we reach them, youwill be comfortably sitting in a seat of the opposition.And this isn't perhaps the right venue, but I wouldlike to hear your plan, not your vision, not yourdream, because that's a what I'm interested in the how.And maybe that's a little too broad here,but perhaps you could touch on it. Thank you.No offense taken.It's a great question, actually, avery real and relevant question.I didn't come here for a comfortable job.I had a very comfortable, successful lifeas a lawyer with my own firm.I didn't want for anything.So this is really not somethingthat I'm doing for comfort.Absolutely not.And I am prepared to do what ittakes to be the next Prime Minister.And what you have stated isexactly what needs to be done.We do not need a leader tobe in Parliament and make fancy speechesand watch themselves afterwards on question period.No, we need a leader to go into the grassroots, togo into those large urban centers that we have not madeinroads in to reach out to people like yourself.Like myself, like many people in this roomwhose families immigrated here, who took chances, whotook risks, and who have those conservative values,they have faith values, they have family values.And our party has not done a good enoughjob in reaching those individuals in those urban centers.I'm going to be out talking to those people, meetingthem, having coffees, knocking on doors, and making sure thatwe make inroads in those centers that will win itand will make me the next Prime Minister.Hi.Thank you for coming.I'm just like the previous guy.I'm immigrant and coming to this countryand really enjoy the liberty that Ienjoyed the past eight years here.I'm also voted conservative all theway until the last election.I reside in the Langley area, and the MP was...I can't remember her name.The reason was that.Sorry about it.I have to tell you that in the lastelection I didn't vote for you. Yeah.You lost about a thousand votes, and oneof them who mo from Conservative to PPC.I'm a member of PPC as well.And one of the reason I'm here, I just want tosee how the next leader of the conservative can win usback, because I think that is a big part.And another reason I'm asking this question is that inthe Truck Convoy, one of the things they ask is aplatform to debate the vaccine and everything about this pandemic.I want to ask a question.Is that when you have a chance, can you providethis platform so the science can be openly debated?Absolutely. Great question.To be honest with you, Maxime Bernie is a friendof mine, and we have a lot in common.So I don't have anything bad to say about him.I do find him to be a courageous person.And I have spoken out againstunfair mandates from the very beginning.I'm one of the few in the party that reallytook the chance, and I paid a price for it.I wasn't given a shadow cabinet position, and itwas largely because of the things that I saw.And one specific thing is when theywere contemplating vaccinating six year olds, andI believe that's a parental choice.And I think that they were talking aboutmake it mandatory to go to school.And I said, you know, with allWith all due respect, I believe in science.I respect science, but this is a parental decision.And I came out and I spoke out against that.And because of that, people were upset with me.And it was a very courageous thing to do.And I've always believed in the fact that any kindof procedure that you endure and that you take intoyour body, it should be a free volition.It should be free choice to do that.Science requires debates, thesis, synthesis, antithesis.That's the scientific the dialectic order.Without that, it is propaganda. it is dictatorship.It is not science.And so when we do not have anopen debate for science, that is problematic.I believe that all the data should be there.All of the information about the vaccines, everythingshould be open so that people can makea free and informed consent about their decisions.And that's what I stand for.Leslyn, I really appreciate what you've been saying.I've been a fan of yours for a long time.There's a couple of issues.Even though everything you said is reallyimportant, there's a couple of issues thatI think perhaps are more important.And I'm very concerned about.And I'm sorry, I don't remember the exactnumber, but the bill to sort of putcontrol on the Internet, I think it's Bill C-11.C-11. Okay.That really troubles me because really it looks well, Ispent a lot of time studying this, and there's alot of people that seem to think that it's reallya way of controlling us and taking away our freedoms.The other one I'm really concernedabout is the vaccine passport.The vaccine mandates have been takenaway, but the passport hasn't.And again, the passport.The end of that, as I'm sure you probably know, isreally control to be able to know where we're going, whatwe do, and they're not going to let that go.There's going to be a real battle there.I'd like to hear your thoughts on those two things. Yes.So the first issue remind me what the first issue was.Vaccine passport. C-11. Great.So, C-11.Have you seen my speech on C eleven?I did a speech in Parliament on C-11.And I concur with everything that you're saying.When the government tells us what we can seein the media, it is a form of control.When you are punching in algorithms you're punchingin search engine search codes and words andalgorithms are popping up that the government dictateswhat you can see, what pops up.That is a form of control.And that is not freedom of the press.Even your Charter Rights, freedom of speech, which isentrenched in the Charter, freedom of association, all ofthose things, they're controlling what you can see.And it's very, very dangerous.I do not support Bill C-11.With respect to the vaccine mandate,I always use the example: sitting in this room,we don't know who's vaccinated and who's not vaccinated, but ifwe went to an airport, the same group of people, somewould be able to get on a plane and some wouldnot be able to get on a plane.And so it is not based on science.It's based on political science.And we cannot have public policy that's basedon political science and not science. Passports.You're absolutely right, because that's tied intothey at some point in time willbe advancing a universal identity. Right?And that is tied into the digitalidentity and even the universal basic income.It is something that once you have young, ablebodied people that are sitting at home and collectinga universal basic income, it's going to be alot easier to control what they do.And all of this is tied in together.I can't stand here and deny what you'resaying is not true, because it is true.The only way that we can oppose all of thismovement towards this global system is by making sure thatyou vote for the next leader, making sure that thatnext leader has the capacity to win a majority governmentso that we can turn things around.Hi. Okay.My question is also about the vaccination.Also, I'm again, I'm from South America.They try the three kind of vaccinations,like Johnson Moderna, and whatever.My country is to be the most country being vaccinated.And my question is that now, I don't agreewith that because it's like Africa and Chile.There are those two countries that are most importantand they are doing big clients in them.Like part of my family.They are already having tside effects of the vaccinations.Some of them.My grandma passed away from that vaccination.My cousin, she's three years old andshe was isolated when she was ill with vaccinesAnd now, like I heard, like they wantto give the vaccine to kids in school.Like, I'm panicking because it's likeyou say, we have freedom.We decide if they have to run or not.Well, I believe in personal responsibility.So I think it's important for peopleto do what they need to doto protect themselves, to protect their neighbors.That's a personal responsibility issue.With respect to the child vaccinations, Idon't believe they're going to be mandatory.There are a lot of people who believe thatthat should be a choice of the parents.And so you'll have a lot of support in that.But as I said, with respect to whetheror not you're vaccinated, I believe it shouldbe based on full and informed consent.The second question is, I don't knowif you got to be aware.This situation happened in 1918, 100 years agoabout the Spanish Flu. What happened at that time?the technology was not like now. People were panicking.at that time, but they say 100 year.And what happens now, 2019 again, when another pandemicis to control and to get rid of people.That's what they were trying to doin the world, in the whole world.Well, let's hope that we get through it.It's been a very traumatizing two years, and I think thatwe have to be on a path to healing and to hope.I'm a social conservative, and you are, and I reallyappreciate what you're bringing to this leadership race.You have my vote. Thank you.But I know a lot of other social conservativeswho are considering voting for Pierre Polliever because theyfeel he is more electable in the general population.So my question for you is, whatwould you say to that person?And maybe you can give me a couple ofreasons why you are more electable than Pierre.Thank you.I ask this as your supporter. Thank you.Thank you so much.Well, I remember speaking to Pierre before I decidedto put my name in, and I said tohim, I just want to hear about your platform.And he was great on thefinancing aspect, on other issues.He just didn't have a lotof concern about those issues.And I feel that in order for us to winand in order for us to keep our conservative familytogether, we're going to have to appeal to the fiscalconservatives, the social conservatives, the libertarians, and the PCs.Everybody has to have a voice within the party.And based on what I've seen and Pierre isa good man, but he believes that in orderto win, you cannot be a social conservative.I want to prove him wrong.I believe you can win as a social conservative.No only that, we have different life experiences.Pierre has been in Parliament his entire life.I have a history of working myway up, building a business, creating wealth,employing people, teaching at University.I have a diverse education.I have a master's of environmentalstudies, a PhD in international law.And I only say these things so thatyou can understand the wealth of experience andeducation that I will bring to this role.I have had people come up to me and sayI'm pro-choice, and I can't believe that I canidentify with you even though you say you're pro-life.And that is because I start fromthe perspective of building bridges and uniting.If you notice the differences in our campaignstyle, you've never heard me speak ill ofany of my colleagues in this race.It is one thing for a conservative to votefor you, but it's another thing to be ableto go in the urban centers to speak toLiberals who like my parents, my parents were ultraconservative in their values, but they voted Liberal.And that is the reality.There are many Liberals who have conservative values.What you have to ask yourself about electability, do yousee that Liberal person voting for Pierre, or do yousee that Liberal person voting for someone like me whois a unifier and a bridge builder and who hasthe education and the experience that can elicit that levelof confidence in that person?One of the aspects of your plank, if Ican call it that, really interested me when Ifirst heard of you, was your climate expertise.Now this is a major issue for the population,for the world internationally, particularly bearing in mind theUnited Nations report that came out just last yearon the impact of climate change.Now we're recognizing through the Ukraine war theabsolute present need yet of fossil fuels.We have a lot of it.You've talked about it. We know it.We know where it is.We're not using it because we're holding offbecause of the climate ideology that is outthere saying we cannot use it.How can you bridge that gap, which to meis one of the major hurdles between the peoplenot only in this country, but throughout the world?Well, I think it's very important that wespeak about the climate and the environment ina manner that it's truthful and not justfrom the state of virtue signaling and propaganda.Because of my master's in environmental studies,I actually have concrete facts and information.Much of our policy is based on hypocrisy.If we are importing 500,000 barrels of oila day, then that means that we stillhave the need to use that resource.If we have the need to use that resource,why is our resource less than a foreign resource?That's the question that we have to ask.Why is our oil inferior?Why do we have legislationto penalize companies in Canada? Bill C.48, Bill C.69 actually favors foreign oil andforeign investment over our own.It's illogical.It doesn't make any sense.And if we actually care about the environment and ifwe're not using fear, because this is what I'm seeing,is that our environmental policy is based on conjuring upfear so that we can impose unjust taxation on people.And that falls on the back of the least ableto afford it falls on the back on the averageCanadian who has to go to the pump and pumpgas, who has to heat their homes.And this is not a sustainable environmental policy.A sustainable environmental policy will haveconfidence in businesses to incentivize themto find innovative solutions.Many of these businesses, they willdiscover technologies that will reduce emissions.Many of our farmers are planting crops thatsequester carbon, but they don't get credit forit, but yet they still have to payan increase carbon tax on drying their crops.That cost trickles down to us in food costs.So a lot of what we're doing doesn't make sense.Many of the regimes, many of thejurisdictions that have the highest carbon taxhave not seen reduced emissions.Donald Trump came out of the Paris Accord, completelycame out of the Paris Accord and met allof the targets, all of the environmental climate targets.We were in the Paris accord, andwe did not meet our targets.So a lot of this is virtue signaling.I think the environment is far too important toplay partisan politics and to virtue signal and tonot have strong concrete policies that allow us todevelop our natural resources while protecting the environment.Thank you, Dr.Lewis, for your answers.I've been a pastor in the region for 24 years closer.Okay.I know there's a lot of pastors. Okay. Yeah.As you're aware, many of the rumor where there's beenabout four or five pastors arrested in the last yearand a half, two years now we have legislation criminalizingour beliefs and hindering actually making criminal our faith andwhat we believe, what we stand for, telling us whowe can actually talk to and who we can't talkto and what we can share and what we can'tshare with our congregations and with people of faith.How would you respond to the new legislation?C-4 and these things that arereally making a big impact on thefaith community, but in particular Christians? Yes.First, I want to say that with C-4,as legislators, I think our job is tomake sure that the best law is passed.And we did not do that, because what youneed to do is you actually should take thelaw through every level, every step to make surethat whether you're for the piece of legislation oryou're against it, to me is irrelevant.What we need to do, what we're elected to do,what we're paid to do, is scrutinize that legislation andto make sure that when it's enacted, it is thebest law and we did not do that.And for that, I offer my apologies to that.There's a whole process of what transpired.I don't want to go into it right now, butwhat I can do is look to the future.I have been communicating with pastors.I've had conversations with Stockwell Bay about this, who introducedme, and that was one of the first things thathe spoke to me about to clarify what happened andhow we're going to make sure that pastors are nottargeted and also to make sure that parents don't facea five year jail term if they have conversations, lovingconversations with their children.We have to remember that adolescence is one of thetoughest times for children and the hallmark one of themost important things to a parent is to be ableto usher their children through to that stage of adulthood.And they do not need any deterrence on them.They do not need a law hanging over themthat could really bind their hands to the pointwhere they are walking on eggshells and making surethat they're there for their children and they're offeringthem loving advice to assist them with their problems.So I will let you know that I amcommitted to making sure that there are no inadvertentconsequences and unintended consequences from C-4.And I will work with Pastors to makesure that this law does not limit theirability to pasture over their flock.Hi, Leslyn, it's good to be here and hear you speak.My question is about the CBC and the media.Should you win the leadership of the party,Rosemary Barton and friends will try to torrentfeather you, will misrepresent, you, will lie aboutyou, as will most of the mainstream media.So my question to you is one,how will you deal with that?And secondly, will you dare to speak toRebel Media or will you run away?Well, I think history answers that question.There was some sort of lock between our partyspeaking to Rebel a few years ago and lastyear in 2020 when I ran for the leader.To be honest with you, Ezra was theperson who came out first for me.And that's where I did myvery first interview on Rebel Media.And surprisingly, like I said, courage is contagious.After that, other Conservatives started todo interviews with Rebel Media.So Rebel Media has actually been a friend to me.Rebel Media had the courage to feature me whenI was not known in the conservative circles.And I credit that to one of the reasonswhy I was able to get myself out thereand known and with the popular vote.So, yes, I would continue speaking withRebel Media because they're my friends.And with respect to the CBC, you're right.We're giving them $1 billion a year.And it's not just the CBC.A lot of legacy media is adopting thispropaganda narrative and not really covering the news.They're giving their opinions on certain issues.And it's always a radical left opinion.And so, yes, I would defund it.I would defund the CBC.Yes, Dr.Lewis, it is a delight to have hearany politician speak as candidly as you do.I'm a semi retired professor of political science.There's a question and a suggestion.The question is this.As you know, in Canada, thefederal government has responsibility for canals,Railways, pipelines that are interprovincial.We do not have a pipeline to EasternCanada because the Quebec government didn't like it.That's one reason we cannot nowsupply oil and gas to Europe.So I'd like you to comment on that.Would you be willing to use the federalpower and then I have a suggestion.You probably have many slogans.I'll give you another: Trudeau must go.I agree with you.Yes.So I think that we must always look to actin the best interest of our national growth and prosperity.And so if it came down to it, yes, I would dowhatever it takes to make sure that I put my country first.And that includes building the pipeline.But we also have another route.We could actually go up through Churchillto Hudson's Bay, and we could getour products to tide water that way.So that's another option instead of goingthrough Quebec that we could entertain.Dr.Lewis, thank you for coming.And good to hear everything.And I would just like tosay that I'm also an immigrant.We are all immigrants to Canada.And the thing about that is itwasn't me, it was my parents.But we all came for a new chance at prosperity.And that's why we love this country,at least the country, before 2015.What I'd like to know is, if you become leaderand will you push for free votes in Parliament?Because MPs represent their community, in theircommunity, let's say chilliwack or Abbotsford.Those people were put them in that officeand they cannot speak what their constituentswant because of the party whipping.If they would just get rid of thewhip except for financial or fiscal reasons, thenthey could speak their mind and say whattheir constituents actually voted them in for locally.Absolutely.That is the cornerstone of our democracy.No MPs should have to voteagainst their conscience or their constituents.And so, as you said, on politics, forfiscal issues, you vote with your party.But on issues of conscience, therewould be absolutely free votes.And even some fiscal issues are borderlinebecause the carbon tax is something thatcould be deemed a fiscal issue.And I can tell you that in mywriting where it's a rural riding with farmers.If I voted for the carbon tax, theywould make sure I am out of there.So that would be voting against my constituents.And even though it's a fiscal issue, Iwouldn't have been able to do it.Very good.So unfortunately, we do have to wrap itup there because we do want to leave.Sometimes you'll be able to ask her in person.So we want to leave some time for people to beable to meet her in person and take pictures with her.I will be playing a job of badcop just because generally people swarm her.So we'll try to cycle peoplethrough as fast as possible.But before we do so, I do want to make apitch and encourage everyone here to get a conservative membership.You can do that by scanning this IQ code.They're both becoming a member anddonating tours are very expensive.Running a leadership campaign is very expensive.And there's a lot of people here.I'm sure some of you have someextra dollars there to help Dr.Lewis become the next Prime Minister.And with regards to membership, it was told to merecently that it's 0.02% of Canada's population that determines whothe leader of a party is and it will logicallyfollow who will be the next Prime Minister.So there's a lot of people in this room,probably close to 600 people, probably not quite 0.02%of Canada's population, but probably quite close.So if you like what you hear today from Dr.Lewis and I think you have and it soundslike you're very concerned with the state of ourcountry as well and you want to affect change.This is the one place you can get involved in politics.You can make a difference.You can go home tonight, sign up five of your friendsand family, and we can get this person as leader ofthe conservative party who can clean up the mess there andthen clean up the mess that is our nation right now.So please do your part.Please become a member.We have some lovely people at the back who wouldbe happy to sign you up, but you can alsodo that just by getting this QR code.You only need to be 14 years of ageto be able to become a member and youonly need to be a permanent resident.So I see some Gray hairs here.You probably have lots of grandchildren as well.So we really have an opportunity here to change the directionof our nation and we all know we need it.Please do that.And with regards to donations, once again,the maximum you can donate is.1675 and once again, I would be lying ifI would not like each

JEAN-PIERRE: Good afternoon, everyone. So, I‚Äôd like to welcome Matthew and Camila McConaughey to the White House today to speak on an urgent issue our nation is currently facing. You may know Matthew as an actor, but more importantly, he is a father; a native of Uvalde, Texas; and a gun own- ‚Äî and a gun owner.
He is here today to use his platform to call on leaders to take bipartisan action to end this senseless killing and pass reasonable gun responsibility measures that we know will save lives.
Just a few minutes ago, Matthew met briefly with the President to talk about the importance of taking action, keeping our communities safe.
But without further ado, I would like to bring up Matthew.
MR. MCCONAUGHEY: Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Here you go.
MR. MCCONAUGHEY: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Camila.
To make the loss of these lives matter.
My wife and I ‚Äî my wife and I ‚Äî Camila ‚Äî we spent most of last week on the ground with the families in Uvalde, Texas, and we shared stories, tears, and memories.
The common thread, independent of the anger and the confusion and sadness, it was the same: How can these families continue to honor these deaths by keeping the dreams of these children and teachers alive?
Again, how can the loss of these lives matter?
So while we honor and acknowledge the victims, we need to recognize that this time it seems that something is different. There is a sense that perhaps there is a viable path forward. Responsible parties in this debate seem to at least be committed to sitting down and having a real conversation about a new and improved path forward ‚Äî a path that can bring us closer together and make us safer as a country, a path that can actually get something done this time.
Camila and I came here to share my stories from my hometown of Uvalde. I came here to take meetings with elected officials on both sides of the aisle. We came here to speak to them, to speak with them, and to urge them to speak with each other ‚Äî to remind and inspire them that the American people will continue to drive forward the mission of keeping our children safe, because it‚Äôs more than our right to do so, it‚Äôs our responsibility to do so.
I‚Äôm here today in the hopes of applying what energy, reason, and passion that I have into trying to turn this moment into a reality. Because as I said, this moment is different. We are in a window of opportunity right now that we have not been in before, a window where it seems like real change ‚Äî real change can happen.
Uvalde, Texas, is where I was born. It‚Äôs where my mom taught kindergarten less than a mile from Robb Elementary. Uvalde is where I learned to master a Daisy BB gun. I took that ‚Äî that took two years before I graduated to a 410 shotgun. Uvalde is where I was taught to revere the power and the capability of the tool that we call a gun. Uvalde is where I learned responsible gun ownership.
And Uvalde called me on May 24th, when I learned the news of this devastating tragedy. I had been out of cellular range working in the studio all day when I emerged and messages about a mass shooting in the town I was born in began flooding my inbox.
In a bit of shock, I drove home, hugged my children a bit tighter and longer than the night before, and then the reality of what had happened that day in the town I was born in set in.
So the next morning, Camila, myself, and the kids, we loaded up the truck and drove to Uvalde. And when we arrived a few hours later, I got to tell you, even from the inside of our vehicle, you could feel the shock in the town. You could feel the pain, the denial, the disillusion, anger, blame, sadness, loss of lives, dreams halted.
We saw ministries. We saw first responders, counselors, cooks, families trying to grieve without it being on the frontpage news.
We met with the local funeral director and countless morticians who ‚Äî who hadn‚Äôt slept since the massacre the day before because they‚Äôd been working 24/7 trying to handle so many bodies at once ‚Äî so many little, innocent bodies who had their entire lives still yet to live.
And that is there that we met two of the grieving parents, Ryan and Jessica Ramirez. Their 10-year-old daughter, Alithia ‚Äî she was one of the 19 children that were killed the day before.
Now, Alithia ‚Äî her dream was to go to art school in Paris and one day share her art with the world. Ryan and Jessica were eager to share Alithia‚Äôs art with us, and said if we could share it, then somehow maybe that would make Alithia smile in heaven. They told us that showing someone else Alithia‚Äôs art would in some way keep her alive.
Now, this particular drawing is a ‚Äî is a self-portrait of Alithia drawing, with her friend in heaven looking down on her drawing the very same picture. Her mother said, of this drawing ‚Äî she said, ‚ÄúYou know, we never really talked to her about heaven before, but somehow she knew.‚Äù
Alithia was 10 years old.
Her father, Ryan ‚Äî this man was steady. He was uncommonly together and calm. When a frazzled friend of his came up and said, ‚ÄúHow are you so calm? I‚Äôd be going crazy,‚Äù Ryan told him ‚Äî he said, ‚ÄúNo, you wouldn‚Äôt. No, you wouldn‚Äôt. You‚Äôd be strong for your wife and kids, because if they see you go crazy, that will not help them.‚Äù
Just a week prior, Ryan got a full-time line job stringing powerlines from pole to pole. And every day since landing that well-paying, full-time job, he reminded his daughter, Alithia ‚Äî he said, ‚ÄúGirl, Daddy going to spoil you now.‚Äù Told her every single night. He said, ‚ÄúDaddy is going to take you to SeaWorld one day.
But he didn‚Äôt get to ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt get to spoil his daughter, Alithia. She did not get to go to SeaWorld.
We also met Ana and Dani- ‚Äî Danilo, the mom and the stepdad of nine-year-old Maite Rodriguez. And Maite wanted to be a marine biologist. She was already in contact with Corpus Christi University of A&M for her future college enrollment. Nine years old.
Maite cared for the environment so strongly that when the city asked her mother if they could release some balloons into the sky in her memory, her mom said, ‚ÄúOh no, Maite wouldn‚Äôt want to litter.‚Äù
Maite wore green high-top Converse with a heart she had hand-drawn on the right toe because they represented her love of nature.
Camila has got these shoes. Can you show these shoes, please?
Wore these every day. Green Converse with a heart on the right toe. These are the same green Converse on her feet that turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting. How about that?
Maite wrote a letter. Her mom said if Maite‚Äôs letter could help someone accomplish her dream, that then her death would have an impact, and it would mean her dying had a point and wasn‚Äôt pointless ‚Äî that it would make the loss of her life matter.
The letter reads: ‚ÄúMarine biologist. I want to pass school to get to my dream college. My dream college is in Corpus Christi, by the ocean. I need to live next to the ocean because I want to be a marine biologist. Marine biologists study animals and the water. Most of the time, I will be in a lab. Sometimes, I will be on TV.‚Äù
Then there was Ellie Garcia, a 10-year-old, and her parents, Steven and Jennifer.
Ellie loved to dance, and she loved church. She even knew how to drive tractors and was already working with her dad and her uncle mowing yards.
‚ÄúEllie was always giving of her gifts, her time, even half-eaten food on her plate,‚Äù they said. They said, ‚ÄúAround the house, we‚Äôd call her the ‚Äògreat re-gifter.‚Äô‚Äù Smiling through tears, her family told us how Ellie loved to embrace. Said she was the biggest hugger in the family.
Now, Ellie was born Catholic, but had been going to Baptist church with her uncle for the last couple of years. Her mom and dad were proud of her because, they said, ‚ÄúShe was learning to love God, no matter where.‚Äù
The week prior to her passing, she had been preparing to read a verse from the Bible for the next Wednesday night‚Äôs church service. The verse was from Deuteronomy 6:5. ‚ÄúAnd thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.‚Äù
That‚Äôs who Ellie was becoming. But she never got to read it. Service is on a Wednesday night.
Then there was the fairytale love story of a teacher named Irma and her husband, Joe. What a great family this was. This was an amazing family.
Camila and I, we ‚Äî we sat with about 20 of their family members in the living room, along with their four kids. They were ‚Äî the kids were 23, 19, 15, and 13. They ‚Äî they shared all these stories about Irma and Joe ‚Äî served the community and would host all these parties, and how Irma and Joe were planning on getting a food truck together when they soon retired.
They were humble, hardworking people. Irma was a teacher, who, her family said, ‚Äúwent above and beyond, and just couldn‚Äôt say no to any kind of teaching.‚Äù Joe had been commuting to and from work 70 miles away in Del Rio for years.
Together, they were the glue of the family. Both worked overtime to support their four kids. Irma even worked every summer when school was out. The money she had made two summers ago paid to ‚Äî paid to paint the front of the house. The money she made last summer paid to paint the sides of the house. This summer‚Äôs work was going to pay to paint the back of the house.
Because Irma was one of the teachers who was gunned down in the classroom, Joe, her husband, literally died of heartache the very next day when he had a heart attack.
They never got to paint the back of the house, they never got to retire, and they never got to get that food truck together.
We also met a cosmetologist. All right? She was well versed in mortuary makeup. That‚Äôs the task of making the victims appear as peaceful and natural as possible for their open-casket viewings.
These bodies were very different. They needed much more than makeup to be presentable. They needed extensive restoration. Why? Due to the exceptionally large exit wounds of an AR-15 rifle. Most of the bodies so mutilated that only DNA tests or green Converse could identify them. Many children were left not only dead, but hollow.
So yes, counselors are going to be needed in Uvalde for a long time. Counselors are needed in all these places where these mass shooters have been for a long time.
I was told by many that it takes a good year before people even understand what to do next. And even then, when they become se- ‚Äî secure enough to take the first step forward, a lifetime is not going to heal those wounds.
Again, you know what every one of these parents wanted, what they asked us for? What every parent separately expressed in their own way to Camila and me? That they want their children‚Äôs dreams to live on. That they want their children‚Äôs dreams to continue to accomplish something after they are gone. They want to make their loss of life matter.
Look, we heard from ‚Äî we heard from so many people, all right? Families of the deceased ‚Äî mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers. Texas Rangers, hunters, Border Patrol, and responsible gun owners who won‚Äôt give up their Second Amendment right to bear arms. And you know what they all said? ‚ÄúWe want secure and safe schools, and we want gun laws that won‚Äôt make it so easy for the bad guys to get these damn guns.‚Äù
So, we know what‚Äôs on the table. We need to invest in mental healthcare. We need safer schools. We need to restrain sensationalized media coverage. We need to restore our family values. We need to restore our American values. And we need responsible gun ownership ‚Äî responsible gun ownership.
We need background checks. We need to raise the minimum age to purchase an AR-15 rifle to 21. We need a waiting period for those rifles. We need red-flag laws and consequences for those who abuse them.
These are reasonable, practical, tactical regulations to our nation, states, communities, schools, and homes.
Responsible gun owners are fed up with the Second Amendment being abused and hijacked by some deranged individuals.
These regulations are not a step back; they‚Äôre a step forward for a civil society and ‚Äî and the Second Amendment.
Look, is this a cure-all? Hell no.
But people are hurting ‚Äî families are, parents are. And look, as ‚Äî as divided as our country is, this gun responsibility issue is one that we agree on more than we don‚Äôt. It really is. But this should be a nonpartisan issue. This should not be a partisan issue.
There is not a Democratic or Republican value in one single act of these shooters. It‚Äôs not.
But people in power have failed to act. So we‚Äôre asking you and I‚Äôm asking you, will you please ask yourselves: Can both sides rise above? Can both sides see beyond the political problem at hand and admit that we have a life preservation problem on our hands?
Because we got a chance right now to reach for and to grasp a higher ground above our political affiliations, a chance to make a choice that does more than protect your party, a chance to make a choice that protects our country now and for the next generation.
We got to take a sober, humble, and honest look in the mirror and re- ‚Äî rebrand ourselves based on what we truly value. What we truly value.
We got to get some real courage and honor our immortal obligations instead of our party affiliations.
Enough with the counterpunching. Enough of the invalidation of the other side. Let‚Äôs come to the common table that represents the American people. Find a mil- ‚Äî middle ground, the place where most of us Americans live anyway, especially on this issue.
Because I promise you, America ‚Äî you and me, who ‚Äî we are not as divided as we‚Äôre being told we are. No.
How about we get inspired? Give ourselves just cause to revere our future again. Maybe set an example for our children, give us reason to tell them, ‚ÄúHey, listen and watch these men and women. These are great American leaders right here. Hope you grow up to be like them.‚Äù
And let‚Äôs admit it: We can‚Äôt truly be leaders if we‚Äôre only living for reelection.
Let‚Äôs be knowledgeable and wise, and act on what we truly believe.
Again, we got to look in the mirror, lead with humility, and acknowledge the values that are inherent to but also above politics. We‚Äôve got to make choices, make stands, embrace new ideas, and preserve the traditions that can create true ‚Äî true progress for the next generation.
With real leadership, let‚Äôs start giving us ‚Äî all of us, with real leadership ‚Äî let‚Äôs start giving all of us good reason to believe that the American Dream is not an illusion.
So where do we start? We start by making the right choices on the issue that is in front of us today.
We start by making laws that save innocent lives and don‚Äôt infringe on our Second Amendment rights. We start right now by voting to pass policies that can keep us from having as many Columbines, Sandy Hooks, Parklands, Las Vegases, Buffaloes, and Uvaldes from here on.
We start by giving Alithia the chance to be spoiled by her dad.
We start by giving Maite a chance to become a marine biologist.
We start by giving Ellie a chance to read her Bible verse at the Wednesday night service.
We start by giving Irma and Joe a chance to finish painting their house, maybe retire and get that food truck.
We start by giving Makenna, Layla, Maranda, Nevaeh, Jose, Xavier, Tess, Rojelio, Eliahna, Annabell, Jackie, Uziyah, Jayce, Jailah, Eva, Amerie, and Lexi ‚Äî we start by giving all of them our promise that their dreams are not going to be forgotten.
We start by making the loss of these lives matter.
Thank you. Thank you.
Q Sir, when you spoke to the President, did he say anything about this? Were you grandstanding just now, sir?
Q Are the changes that are being discussed (inaudible), Mr. McConaughey?
Q What‚Äôs your response to (inaudible)?
Q What was your message to the President, Mr. McConaughey?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. I know that the President has an event right after this. I think it‚Äôs running ‚Äî it‚Äôs running a few minutes ‚Äî a few minutes behind. So, I will ‚Äî we‚Äôll do the briefing until we have to ‚Äî we have to move to the event.
I have a couple of things at the top, and then we‚Äôll open it up.
As I just mentioned, soon the President will sign into law nine bipartisan bills that support veterans, and he will be joined by members of Congress from both parties, veteran advocates, and veterans who will benefit from these laws.
President Biden ran on the promise to unite the country, which is why supporting veterans is a key part of his Unity Agenda announced at the State of the Union. Supporting our country‚Äôs veterans is an issue that all Americans can agree on.
Among the impact of the bills being signed into law today are two that will improve access to breast imaging services for veterans, including those who experienced toxics ‚Äî toxic exposures during military service.
Other bills to be signed include three to honor the legacy of service to our nation, including one to award a single Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Army Rangers World War II. The Rangers played a crucial role in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, which began exactly 78 years ago yesterday.
Also today, the Senate voted to advance the PACT Act. The President was clear in his State of the Union that addressing toxic exposures is a priority and Congress should move with the urgency for our veterans.
Today, Congress took a major step forward. President Biden looks forward to final passage of this legislation so that he can sign it into law and continue to uphold our sacred obligation to support those who have served our nation, their families, caregivers, and survivors.
Today, the administration announced new investments from the American Rescue Plan to help provide every American with access to affordable high-speed Internet.
These investments will bring down costs for families and small businesses, particularly in rural and remote areas, and ensure affordability.
This morning, Treasury announced the first state awards from the $10 billion Capital Projects Fund, which will make resources immediately available in Louisiana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and West Virginia to connect over 200,000 homes that currently lack access.
On a sad note, our dear friend and colleague, Michael Gwin, will be leaving us for Treasury, where he will be ser- ‚Äî where he will serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Gwin has served as the White House Director of Rapid Response for the past 16 months, responding to the most challenging and difficult issues imaginable. Yet, amidst these often emotionally-wrenching stories, Gwin‚Äôs poise and moral clarity are unfailing, and his willingness and ability to step up has made him an indispensable member of the team.
And joining Gwin at the Treasury Department will be our very own Michael Kikukawa, where he will serve as a spokesperson. Michael, better known here to all of you, to all of us as ‚ÄúKiku,‚Äù has served not just as a Press Assistant but as the strong engine and reliable engine at the press shop. His relentless work ethic and dedication to the mission of this team have been second to none.
Kiku and Gwin, we will miss you both. Thank you so much. Very heart-wrenching, but I‚Äôm very excited for both of you. Wishing you the best.
And we do have some ‚Äúhellos.‚Äù I know we keep announcing people leaving, but we actually have people coming, backfilling ‚Äî some great, great folks who are joining our team. Two new members who are here to our team.
I‚Äôd like to first introduce Abdullah Hasan right here ‚Äî some of you know him already ‚Äî who will be joining us as an Assistant Press Secretary, having previously served as the Deputy Associate Director for Communications for the White House Office of Management and Budget. Amongst many topics, Abdullah will be covering civil rights, immigration, and climate.
We also would like to extend a warm welcome to Alexandra LaManna ‚Äî hello ‚Äî who is joining us on detail from Treasury, where she has served as senior spokesperson. Part of Alexandra‚Äôs profile will be working on housing, infrastructure implementation, and other economic issues.
Abdullah and Alexandra haven‚Äôt even gotten their full-time badges yet, but we are already getting them hard at work, and we appreciate all of their work thus far. It has ‚Äî we have felt the impact of it.
Okay, please join me in welcoming the team.
And with that, I think that‚Äôs all I have. All right. Go ahead. Go ahead, Zeke.
Q Thanks, Karine. I know we‚Äôre getting ready to start here kind of late, and (inaudible) briefing, I‚Äôm hoping you might be able to pick this up after the President‚Äôs event, just because we got a lot of people who have questions.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I hear you. I have other ‚Äî I have other obligations as well after this, so we‚Äôll see. We‚Äôll see what we can do. But I can‚Äôt make any promises. But let‚Äôs ‚Äî why don‚Äôt we get going?
Q Great. So, on the subject of guns, the President had a meeting with Chris Murphy, but he didn‚Äôt speak to the public today. Does the President have a clearer sense of where things are, what is possible on Capitol Hill? And also, why is he turning to a Hollywood actor to make the message ‚Äî take the message to the American people? Does he feel like his voice doesn‚Äôt matter?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: His voice does matter. You heard him speak on Thursday very clearly, very loudly, very passionately during primetime at a ‚Äî at a critical time during the day where he made sure that he can communicate with the American people.
And so ‚Äî he‚Äôs the President of the United States. His voice carries and it does matter. What he says is ‚Äî has ‚Äî carries weight that is pretty tremendous.
Matthew was here because, as you heard, he has a very personal connection to Uvalde. He met with the family. He is from there. He was born there. He lives in Texas. And we thought hearing from him directly, him using his platform, is incredibly important.
We all know what it‚Äôs like or how important it is for folks ‚Äî especially on ‚Äî whether you are an actor, whether you are in the business sector, wherever you are ‚Äî to use your platform, how critical and important it is.
And I think his words here today were incredibly powerful and emotional. And I thank him and Camila for coming here today. They met with the President, as I just mentioned. And so I just, you know, wanted to just address that, Zeke.
The President received an update, as ‚Äî as you all know, as we‚Äôve mentioned, from Senator Murphy on the state of negotiations on Capitol Hill. He told Senator Murphy he strongly support his efforts to find a compromise, and encouraged him to get the strongest possible results.
In the end, the President said that the message he took from the families from ‚Äî at Uvalde, when he was there, was to do something. It was to ‚Äúplease do something.‚Äù That‚Äôs what the grieving family told him. Some of you heard that yourselves from the community memb- ‚Äî from the community when he was in Uvalde. And so that is what Senator Murphy and his colleagues are going to do. They‚Äôre going to do just that.
Q And on a different ‚Äî just on a different subject, the President is meeting with President Bolsonaro of Brazil. The AP is reporting that the Brazilian government, that President Bolsonaro wanted concessions from the President for that meeting and for his attendance at the Summit of the Americas that he wouldn‚Äôt bring up Bolsonaro‚Äôs casting doubts about Brazil‚Äôs election system as well as environmental concerns in the Amazon. Can you confirm that report?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I cannot confirm that report. The President is looking forward to leaving tomorrow to head to the summit that clearly that we‚Äôre ‚Äî that we are hosting.
I can say this: The United States continues to recognize Juan Guaid√≥ as the Interim President of Venezuela. That said, while the interim government was not invited to participate in the main summit, they are welcome to participate in all three stakeholder forums and other events.
Go ahead.
Q Is the President now getting more directly involved in the negotiations on the Hill now that he has met with Senator Murphy?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I ‚Äî you know, I want to be very clear here: Senator Murphy has said this many times during interviews on various networks here that he believes it‚Äôs time for the Senate to act. And that is what they‚Äôre doing.
The President is encouraged about what he is seeing with this team of negotiators on the ‚Äî on the Senate side. And he is, like I said, encouraged and wants to continue to see them move forward and take action.
Q And in the meeting with Matthew McConaughey, did ‚Äî did McConaughey go through the same elements with the President that he did here at the podium?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, they had a private conversation. I‚Äôm not going to readout their private conversation.
As you can imagine, the President went to Uvalde himself. He also met ‚Äî met with many of the family members. He also is ‚Äî heard many of the stories that Matthew came here to ‚Äî to share with all of you. So, they certainly connected on that aspect.
Q Thanks, Karine.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.
Q Is the President willing to accept whatever agreement lawmakers come to, should they come to an agreement, when it comes to guns?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, here‚Äôs ‚Äî as you know, the President has been very involved in gun reform as senator, as Vice President, and, clearly, now as President, having signed the most executive actions on gun reform than any president at this time of their presidency.
And when ‚Äî when he was senator, he was ‚Äî he was talking about this today ‚Äî it took him years. It took him years to get the 1994 assault ban ‚Äî assault ban legislation. Now, that ‚Äî that was law for 10 years and expired in 2004.
And so, we haven‚Äôt seen this type of ‚Äî this type of negotiations or this type of coming together from both sides in a very long time. It‚Äôs been decades.
So, he is encouraged, he is optimistic about what ‚Äî about what he‚Äôs seeing, about what he is hearing ‚Äî the update that he received. And so, we‚Äôre going to see how those negotiations go.
And any ‚Äî any step, we bel- ‚Äî he believes any step is a step forward. He‚Äôs going to continue to call for all of the things that you heard him lay out, when it comes to what he sees as comprehensive gun reform, on Thursday. But he also believes that any step forward is a ‚Äî is important.
Clearly, we‚Äôre not going to negotiate from here. And we‚Äôre going to leave the specifics to the senators.
Q And one other question: Does he still seek to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I spoke to this ‚Äî I spoke to this yesterday. And I could share some more thoughts on that now.
But look, the President was very clear when he was asked about this on ‚Äî on Friday, when he was delivering his remarks on the economy. And basically, he said, as President, he believes that if there is any ‚Äî any way to get peace, he feels like he should take that ‚Äî he should take that direction.
So, Saudi Arabia has been a strategic partner of the United States for eight decades. Every president since FDR has met with Saudi leaders. And the President considers Saudi Arabia an important partner on a host of regional and global strategies, including other efforts to end the war in Yemen, contain Iran, and counter terrorism.
Saudi pilots flew with ours in the war against ISIS, its navy patrols with ‚Äî with ours in the Red Sea and the Gulf, and the U.S. military personnel are based in Saudi Arabia.
As I‚Äôve said, the President will meet with any leader if it serves the interests of the American people. That‚Äôs what he puts first. He believes engagement with Saudi leaders clearly meets that test, as has every president before him.
I‚Äôm going to move around ‚Äî
Q But all of those things were true ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I‚Äôm going to move around, Ka- ‚Äî I‚Äôm going move around.
Q All of those things were true ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I‚Äôm going to move around. I‚Äôm going to ‚Äî
AIDE: Hey, Karine. He‚Äôs about to get started.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I‚Äôm going to ‚Äî really? Okay, I‚Äôm going to take one more.
Q All of those things were true when the President vowed to make them a pariah state. So, I‚Äôm just curious: What changed?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I‚Äôm going to take ‚Äî I‚Äôm ‚Äî I‚Äôm going to ‚Äî Kaitlan, I‚Äôm going to take one more. I‚Äôm going to take one more.
Q Just, on these negotiations: If changing background checks for younger people than 21 is what ends up happening, opening these juvenile records to more scrutiny is what comes of this, does the President believe that that is meaningful change? Is that satisfying? If that‚Äôs what comes of this moment, is he okay with that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the President was clear last week that there‚Äôs real urgency and ‚Äî to make sure something like Uvalde or Buffalo and many mass shootings prior can‚Äôt happen again. And we‚Äôre encouraged, again, by the progress that we‚Äôre seeing.
You know, we‚Äôre ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to stay closely engaged. We‚Äôre going to not negotiate from here. We‚Äôre going to let the contours of the legislation and those conversations play out. And what we are encouraged by is that the conversation is happening, both sides are coming together. We saw the House taking some ‚Äî taking some actions last week. They‚Äôre ‚Äî they also will take some actions this week.
What we ‚Äî what the President believes is that we have to do something. And like he said on Thursday, ‚ÄúEnough is enough.‚Äù
Q Is he confident there‚Äôll be a deal by the end of the week?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I ‚Äî I can‚Äôt speak to the timeline. That is it going to be up to Senator Schumer and ‚Äî and Chris Murphy and their conversations that we‚Äôre having.
(The press briefing stops for the presidential bill signing.)
(The press briefing resumes.)
Q Welcome back.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I am ‚Äî I am back by popular demand.
Q Appreciate it. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, absolutely. I‚Äôm ‚Äî and look, I just want to be very clear here ‚Äî you know, sorry about that. There are times where briefings get delayed for reasons outside of our control, and we wanted to make sure you all had the opportunity to cover the President signing those bills for ‚Äî to support veterans, which is incredibly important, as you all know.
And so, taking your questions is very important to us and ‚Äî which is why we do it almost every day and ‚Äî when we can. And it‚Äôs why we strive to be responsive to your questions here in the briefing room; on TV, as I did this morning; and in individual conversations with administration officials. And our team does this on a daily basis.
So, with that, I wanted to just come in and take additional questions for a few more minutes. And, you know, I know a lot ‚Äî a lot of you have deadlines yourselves and have to do evening TV. So I won‚Äôt be here for too long, but I did want to come out and take some ‚Äî and take some questions.
Okay. Let‚Äôs see. All right. I‚Äôm going to try and call on people I haven‚Äôt called and start in the back, but there is like all these ‚Äî
Go ahead. Go ahead. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve called on you yet.
Q Not lately, so thank you.
Listen, Matthew McConaughey was banging on that podium just a few minutes ago before he left, and he had some specific policy asks. And a lot of them were ‚Äî not all of them, but a lot were about guns.
He wanted to raise the age from 18 to 21 for AR-15s. He talked about a waiting period for AR-15s. And he talked about red-flag laws and background checks.
So my question is: You and the President have made very generalized comments lately about doing something. Why won‚Äôt he demand one of those things be in an overall package?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You‚Äôre talking about the President ‚Äî why won‚Äôt he demand ‚Äî
Q I know he supports the policies, but ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q ‚Äî is his message to these negotiators that those gun measures needs to be ‚Äî need to be in the package?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: His message to the negotiators is that we have to do something. His message is, to the American people: We have to do something.
He went to Uvalde, as you know. He went to Buffalo. And when he was in Uvalde ‚Äî and I was there with him, and we ‚Äî and some of you were there with him as well ‚Äî the thing ‚Äî the two words that he heard over and over again is please ‚Äî is: Do something.
And so, he is very encouraged by the engagement that he‚Äôs seeing on the Senate side with the bipartisan group. And he wants to give them the space. We‚Äôre not going to negotiate from here on what should be in the package, what should not be in the package.
But we believe it‚Äôs a step forward. The President is going to continue to ‚Äî continue to call for and fight for all of the comprehensive components for ‚Äî to prevent gun violence that he talked about on Thursday. That will not stop. He‚Äôs going to continue to do that. But we‚Äôre just not going to negotiate from here.
Q And John Cornyn, in his public comments, was talking today on the Senate floor about really hardening doors at schools and these sort of items. If the package only has that and not one of these specific gun measures, will it be a success?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Again, I‚Äôm not going to negotiate from here. We‚Äôre going to let them ‚Äî give them some space. It‚Äôs a bipartisan ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bipartisan conversation that‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs going to be a bipartisan agreement, we ‚Äî we see or we feel.
And you know, Senator Murphy is very optimistic. And we‚Äôre ‚Äî and he has said this is the most optimistic that he has been in some time. And he came in, as you know, and gave an update to the President.
So we‚Äôre going to see how this ‚Äî this conversation continues to go.
Go ahead.
Q Thank you, Karine. Why do you think it is that 83 percent of people polled by The Wall Street Journal say the economy is ‚Äúpoor‚Äù or ‚Äúnot so good‚Äù?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, when it comes to consumer confidence ‚Äî is what you‚Äôre talking about there ‚Äî we know that can reflect concern and uncertainty about higher prices. People feel the effect of high prices when they go to the grocery store and they fill up their gans- ‚Äî gas tank, which the President understands very personally ‚Äî when he was growing up and understanding how ‚Äî how when prices elevate even just a bit, how much that can hurt a family, how much that can really affect, you know, someone‚Äôs household.
But the fact is: We are in a fundamentally different place compared to when the President took office and compared to this time a year ago.
And so, you know, during this President ‚Äî during his pres- ‚Äî this presidency, people felt uncertainty ‚Äî uncertain about the economy generally, but they actually felt as good about their personal financial situations as they ever have, according to the Federal Reserve survey, with nearly 80 percent of adults reporting that they are financially comfortable.
So, that matters as well.
Q But to the point about the ‚Äî you‚Äôre saying that people feel good about their personal financial situation. High gas prices, people can‚Äôt get baby formula, the supply chain is messed up, everything is more expensive. Where‚Äôs the good part?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the survey that I just read off started in 2013. And that is the first time that we saw numbers like this since 2013. So that does ‚Äî no, that does mean something. Just like you gave me 83 percent, I‚Äôm giving you ‚Äî
Q And I understand that. Another number then ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I ‚Äî
Q ‚Äî newer than 2013, 61 percent are saying now, in this Wall Street Journal poll, they are generally pessimistic about people having an opportunity to achieve the American Dream. How‚Äôs that going look on a ‚Äî on a bumper sticker?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I‚Äôm ‚Äî I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say, Peter, is that we understand that people are feeling ‚Äî feeling this. They are feeling the increase of prices, which ‚Äî with food, in particular, right now, and gas. That is ‚Äî that is something that we understand.
What we‚Äôre trying to say, what I‚Äôm trying to say to you is that the economy is in a better place than it has been historically.
And so, we feel, here at this administration and other experts as well, is that ‚Äî we feel that we are in a good position to take on inflation. We are in a good position to really start really working on lowering prices.
We leave that piece to the Federal Reserve. They have the monetary policies to deal with the best ‚Äî to have the best tools to make sure that we bring down inflation. That‚Äôs the ‚Äî that‚Äôs the pain that the American family is feeling.
And so, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre saying. We‚Äôre trying to ‚Äî what we‚Äôre saying is that we were in a different place a year ago, and now we are in a much better place economically. But there‚Äôs still work to do, and we understand that.
Q Okay. And then, just quickly, on gas prices. The Energy Secretary, Granholm, is saying, ‚ÄúOh, well, if you went to Canada, you‚Äôd be paying $6.25 a gallon. If you went to Germany, you‚Äôd be paying over $8.80. In the UK, it‚Äôs almost $8 a gallon.‚Äù What kind of an argument is that: ‚ÄúJust be happy you don‚Äôt live in Munich‚Äù?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think what she was ‚Äî what she‚Äôs trying to say and what we have all been trying to say is this is a global challenge. This is not just in the United States that people are feeling inflation or people are seeing elevated gas prices. This is a global challenge.
Q And isn‚Äôt it the President‚Äôs job to protect Americans from global challenges?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: He‚Äôs doing ‚Äî he‚Äôs doing his part in trying to make sure that we ‚Äî the American people feel the impact less.
But here‚Äôs the thing, and we‚Äôve talked about this: Since Russia invaded Ukraine, we have seen gas prices ‚Äî these are the facts ‚Äî go up by $1.51. We have seen food prices go up because of what ‚Äî of what Ukraine and Russia represent when it comes to wheat and corn. This is just a fact. This is what we have seen for the past several months.
The President has done ‚Äî he‚Äôs tapped into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a historic way with a million ‚Äî a million barrels of oil a month for six months. We did ‚Äî we made the announcement of the E15, the homegrown biofuels that is going to help families in the Midwest.
So, we know there is more to do. We‚Äôre not disagreeing here. We know that there is more to do, and we‚Äôre going to continue to do the work.
Q Does the President have any plans to invite any Republican senators to the White House before he leaves for Los Angeles?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have any meetings to preview for you at this point.
Q Has he spoken to any Republicans as it comes to gun legislation?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don‚Äôt have ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have any meetings to ‚Äî or calls to read out.
Okay, go ahead.
Q Karine, thank you. I know you don‚Äôt want to negotiate from the podium. I just want to try one more time. It seems as though talks are coalescing around more funding for mental health, school safety, and then expanded background checks and encouraging states to adapt red-flag laws. Is that the type of compromise legislation the President would sign? Would he sign that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I ‚Äî again, I‚Äôm not going to negotiate from here. We don‚Äôt want to ‚Äî I‚Äôm not going to talk through the contours of the plan. They‚Äôre still having those conversations on the other side of the Hill.
Q I guess the question is ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: But I can say ‚Äî but no, no. Let me ‚Äî
Q Okay.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Let me finish. I‚Äôll get to ‚Äî hopefully this will answer it, which is: He supports red-flag laws. That is something that he has supported for some time. He even talked about the red-flag law that is in Delaware ‚Äî is named after his son, Beau Biden, who was, as you know, the Attorney General of ‚Äî in Delaware.
He has talked about expanding background checks. I have talked about it. He has talked about it. We‚Äôve all talked about it.
So, clearly, those are two things that we know are popular. The red-flag law ‚Äî red-flag law we saw ‚Äî I read a poll here last ‚Äî yesterday that has 72 percent for the red-flag laws. We know that expanding background check is overwhelmingly popular as well.
So, clearly, those are two things that he support. But I just don‚Äôt ‚Äî we do not want to get ‚Äî give them some space, don‚Äôt want to get in the middle of their negotiation.
Q I guess what I‚Äôm asking, Karine ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, sure.
Q ‚Äî is, particularly as it relates to the red-flag laws, what it seems to be coalescing around is a deal that would encourage states to adapt red-flag laws. Is that good enough for President Biden?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think it‚Äôs a step. It‚Äôs ‚Äî when red-flag laws are actually enacted, it saves lives. We have seen that in Florida. We‚Äôve seen that in other states across the country. In California, there‚Äôs been cases where the red-flag law has actually saved lives.
And we know, we understand not every component of what the President is calling for is going to stop every tragedy, but we have to take the steps, and we have to move forward, and we have to do something.
Q There‚Äôs been so much focus on the legislation. Is President Biden considering any new executive actions on the (inaudible) guns?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You know, the President said this himself: If there is any way or any other new actions that he can take, he will. His team ‚Äî
Q Is he actively considering any?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: There‚Äôs nothing that I can ‚Äî that I can preview for you at this time. I know that the team is looking at that. We just don‚Äôt have anything for you ‚Äî to share at this time.
Q Let me ask you on Roe v. Wade, if I might. We are anticipating the Supreme Court will render its final decision on Roe v. Wade. And based on, of course, that leaked draft report, it appears as though the Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.
What, if any, groundwork is the President, is this administration laying to ensure that women who want or need abortions can still have access to them?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, protecting the constitutional rights of Americans afforded by Roe for ‚Äî for nearly 50 years, ensuring that women can make their own choices about their lives and bodies and families, is something that the President and the Vice President support.
For ‚Äî for we‚Äôve ‚Äî we‚Äôve taken actions over the past ‚Äî the past year and a half on making sure that ‚Äî making sure that women have the protection that they need, issuing a presidential memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive repre- ‚Äî reproductive healthcare and to revoke the Mexico City policy, a global gag rule that prohibits federal funding for organizations that provide abortion, counseling, and/or referrals; issuing a final rule to strengthen the Title 10 Family Planning Program, fulfilling the administration‚Äôs commitment to restore access to equitable, affordable, client-centered quality family planning services.
So, we have done ‚Äî we have done an array of things over the past year and a half to give the protection that women need.
Obviously, the decision, it was a draft decision. We don‚Äôt want to get into hypotheticals and we don‚Äôt want to get ahead of of what is actually going to come forth. But it‚Äôs something that it concerns us. All of the pieces of legislation that we see coming out of the states that are incredibly radical, we‚Äôve called them that and it does give us concern.
Q Are there any tangible actions that the administration will take if it‚Äôs overturned on that day or that week to ensure that women who need abortions can have access to them or that they can cross state lines to access an abortion?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, one thing that I can say ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have anything to preview or to announce or to lay out at this time. What I can say is that our team here ‚Äî the Gender Policy Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the agencies who are involved, like HHS ‚Äî have been in constant communication with ‚Äî with groups on what we can do from here. I just don‚Äôt have anything to preview.
Q Karine, the January 6th Committee is going to hold its first public hearing on Thursday while the President is in California. Do you expect the President to get briefed on what the committee has found in its investigation, if he hasn‚Äôt already? And how is he looking at these hearings? Does he see this as something that will move the needle in how the public perceives what happened on that day?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, we‚Äôre leaving, as you were kind of alluding to, tomorrow, and we‚Äôre going to go to LA. The President is going to have a very busy week. And, you know, of course, will be keeping up on the committee‚Äôs work, as he has been. And I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be following the news from the hearing as well.
I don‚Äôt have anything else to ‚Äî in particular to share here. The President has been consistent voicing his support for the vital work of the bipartisan January 6th Select Committee. And he and his team have said many times it is critical that we have a full investigation into the events of January 6th to ensure something like what we saw that day can never happen again. And the work of this committee is crucial to that effort. And we will continue to speak out as appropriate or to defend our democracy and the rule of law, and to support those who are doing work to protect our democracy.
Q Just one more. Senator Romney and Senator Ossoff have asked for a full investigation into the death of Shireen Abu Akleh. She was a Palestinian American journalist with Al Jazeera. She was killed last month while reporting in the West Bank. Will the White House be supporting an investigation into her death?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, we‚Äôre in close touch with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities. The United States is not currently conducting an official investigation. As you know, we are working to bridge cooperation between the two parties.
We have made clear our view to both Israeli and Palestinian officials the administration‚Äôs call for thorough, transparent, and impartial investigation of her ‚Äî of her killing. We expect full accountability for those responsible. We have also urged that both sides share their evidence with each other.
We continue to call on all sides to maintain calm and avoid any further escalation.
Q Karine, thanks so much. Secretary Yellen said over the weekend to CNN that she was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in predicting that inflation was transitory. And shortly afterward, Treasury walked back the statement. I‚Äôm just curious if the White House or any senior aides here were involved in walking back that ‚Äî those comments.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: What I can tell you is that she ‚Äî she was ‚Äî even when you look at the transcript, she was clear on exactly what she meant by that. And she ‚Äî she ‚Äî the Secretary, you know, spoke to this herself to clarify her remarks. And it‚Äôs true that nobody at the time foresaw the extent of the global challenges that have caused record inflation all around the world. In fact, even Wall Street and the private sector broadly thought that inflation would come down faster than it has.
I cannot speak to private conversation. But all I can say is she put out a ‚Äî as you know, put out a statement clarifying what she said.
Q And just one more question. On Friday, senior White House staff met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus to talk about some of the President‚Äôs ideas for forgiving student debt. I‚Äôm wondering: What was the purpose of that meeting, as the President considers it? And was there any outcome from it?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don‚Äôt have any readout from that meeting from Friday night.
Q Thank you. Based on what you know about the situation in both Uvalde and Buffalo, is there anything that the Senate negotiators are considering now that would have stopped those two shootings, or even one of them?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I ‚Äî look, I ‚Äî you know, I‚Äôm no expert here, but one thing that I do know that we all know is that both the shooters were 18. And one of the things that are ‚Äî that‚Äôs on the table is raising the age limit.
Q Are you sure that‚Äôs on the table?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: What ‚Äî I‚Äôm so sorry ‚Äî
Q Raising the age limit from 18 to 21 to buy AR-15s? Because John Cornyn has said that‚Äôs not on the table.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs been discussed. I don‚Äôt ‚Äî
Q Oh, I see. Okay.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I‚Äôm ‚Äî
Q Okay. If that was on the table, that would have affected these.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, I ‚Äî
Q Okay. But ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You‚Äôre ‚Äî you‚Äôre asking me a question of when I thought ‚Äî what I think may have helped or ‚Äî stopped this awful (inaudible).
Q Certainly it would have been. But in terms of what‚Äôs on the table in the Senate?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don‚Äôt ‚Äî I‚Äôm just saying that‚Äôs been one of the conversations that‚Äôs been out there. I do not know. Again, we‚Äôre not negotiating from here. I‚Äôm just trying to make a point. This is something that the President supports ‚Äî raising the age from 18 to 21. Because one of the things that we do know is both of the shooters were 18 years old. The one in Uvalde, in particular, when he was 17, he asked his sister to buy him a gun. She said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù And as soon as he turned 18, he went and bought ‚Äî he bought ‚Äî he bought a gun.
And so, that is something that we have heard about, that‚Äôs out there, and that is something the President talked about on Thursday.
And so, I was just speaking to your question on what you ‚Äî what I ‚Äî what, potentially, could have helped.
Q Well, I‚Äôm actually asking what the sen- ‚Äî what among the things the senators are considering could have prevented this?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And, again, I‚Äôm not going to negotiate from here. I‚Äôm just trying to help in a way to show, ‚ÄúHey, this is something that we know is out there.‚Äù This is something that the President talked about. I‚Äôm not going to negotiate from here. They‚Äôre working through the contours of the plan, and we‚Äôre going to let them figure that out.
Q Can I just ask one quick one on red-flag laws? So does the ‚Äî does the President prefer a federal red-flag law? Or does he think it‚Äôs better on a state-by-state level and the government ‚Äî or the federal government should incentivize states instead?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, he supports a red- ‚Äî he supports ‚Äî I want to be really careful here because he‚Äôs not going to ‚Äî we‚Äôre not going to negotiate from here. Right? We are going to allow the ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to give them the space to come up with the contours of ‚Äî of the deal. And we‚Äôre just going to give them that space.
What we‚Äôre saying is: We support the red-flag law. The Pre- ‚Äî the President has talked about it. I‚Äôm not going to go into the nitty-gritty of what that looks like. We‚Äôre going to let the negotiators figure that out.
Go ahead, Karen.
Q Thanks, Karine. First ‚Äî or two questions. First, can you commit that going forward, if there was a guest or a celebrity here that you would ensure that they would stay at the podium and take questions from reporters ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, I ‚Äî
Q ‚Äî after they speak?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That ‚Äî they‚Äôre a guest. That is not for me to ensure.
Q Can you try to have them stay and take questions?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I ‚Äî they‚Äôre ‚Äî Karen, they‚Äôre a guest of ours. It is up to them if they want to take questions or not. We respect them and what they want to do.
Matthew was here. And when he was done, he said thank you and he walked away.
That is ‚Äî that really is up to ‚Äî is up to him.
Q And on COVID: Last week, a guest, Dr. Jha, was here. But he did take questions after ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.) Yeah, well that‚Äôs a little different. He works here. (Laughs.)
Q Absolutely. We appreciated him taking questions, but ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.
Q He said that what keeps them awake at night is that the U.S. would run out of vaccines, not have enough of the next generation of vaccines, run out of treatments and tests in the fall. And this is something he has been saying a lot in interviews recently.
But can you give us an update on where the COVID funding talks stand on the Hill, in terms of what the White House is doing right now? What officials are meeting with lawmakers up there? Has there been any progress? Has the President talked with lawmakers about this? And is this getting overshadowed with the conversations that are happening right now on gun talks?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, it‚Äôs a very good question. You know, look, just to kind of reiterate a little bit of what Dr. Jha has said is: Without additional funding, you know, we are unable to purchase li- ‚Äî lifesaving treatments for the American people, including our most vulnerable. We‚Äôre already ‚Äî we‚Äôve already cut down on our purchase of treatments for high-risk Americans.
Imagine an ‚Äî a 13-year-old with a heart condition who may not be able to access preventive treatment to stay safe from a life-threatening illness.
We‚Äôre losing our spot in line while other countries are moving forward and buying next-generation vaccines for all Americans that may be needed in the fall and winter.
So I think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs talking about when he says he‚Äôs losing ‚Äî he‚Äôs losing sleep. You know, when we think about the path forward and how we‚Äôre going to get to where we need to be ‚Äî you know, we are working closely with members of Congress on a bipartisan basis to drive a path forward on COVID funding, and the President is committing to get ‚Äî committed to getting that ‚Äî getting it done.
And so, Dr. Jha and OMB Director have been ‚Äî have been on the Hill having those meetings.
So, you know, the President deals with multiple things at a time. So this is still a ‚Äî very much a priority. So we will continue doing our part to protect the American people. We‚Äôll use the few funds we have remaining to continue getting testing, treatments, and vaccine out to the ‚Äî to Americans for as long as we can.
We will continue to work the phones, hold briefings, and make our case public ‚Äî publicly and privately with lawmakers, imploring Congress to act immediately (inaudible) on our long-overdue COVID ‚Äî to act on our long-overdue COVID needs.
And at the end of the day, it‚Äôs Republicans in Congress ‚Äî they need to act. They have to answer to the American people if they can‚Äôt get the vaccine treatments and tests that we will need come fall.
So, you know, we‚Äôre going to continue doing the work. The work doesn‚Äôt stop.
Q (Cross-talk by reporters.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, my gosh.
S.V.
Q Yeah, thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q Following up on the January 6th question: There have been Republicans ‚Äî prominent Republicans, as well as outside groups, who are already making a concerted effort to downplay the entire thing before a single word has been said about ‚Äî in the hearings. Has the President ‚Äî what are his thoughts about that? And has he made any efforts to reach out to Kevin McCarthy, to Mitch McConnell about, ‚ÄúHey, this is important. We ought to be on the same page with this‚Äù?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So the President has been really clear ‚Äî right? ‚Äî he supports the bipartisan effort ‚Äî the January 6th Select Committee bipartisan effort. But we‚Äôre not going to get involved. That is something that is independent and needs to stay independent.
You know, it is important to protect our democracy. That is something that the President ‚Äî what happened on January 6th was a very dark day in our democracy. And so, we have to continue to find ways to protect it.
So he supports what they‚Äôre doing. We‚Äôre not going to get involved. It‚Äôs an independent committee.
Q Karine? Karine? Back here.
Q Yeah, so you said that we‚Äôre in a stable economic ‚Äî or we‚Äôre transitioning into a stable economic growth. The Treasury Secretary also testified today we‚Äôre going to a stable economic growth. What exactly is a ‚Äústable economic growth‚Äù?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think the way that we‚Äôre looking at it is just the data, just what we have seen in this past year.
I think people forget what the President inherited when he walked in. You had 20 million people who were collecting unemployment benefits. You ‚Äî you had ‚Äî unemployment was at more than 6 percent.
And the work that he did with the American Rescue Plan, getting that done, and the Democrats ‚Äî only Democrats voting for it, helped get the economy moving, helped get the economy growing.
And so, the way we see it is that we are in a strong place. The U.S. economy may grow faster this year than China‚Äôs economy for the first time since 1976. With ‚Äî with the right policies, we are confident that the U.S. can transition from recovery to stable, steady growth and bring down inflation without giving all of these historic gains that I just laid out ‚Äî 8.7 million new jobs in this past year and a half.
And so, one of the things that we‚Äôve been very clear about is giving the Federal Reserve the independence to deal with inflation. And they are committed to it; we are committed to it. And they have the strongest tools to come up with monetary policy to get that done.
Q So ‚Äî but is that ‚Äî is that GDP growth, like under the Obama administration, 1.5 percent, 1.8 percent for the year?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, I‚Äôm not going to get into, like, the specifics of GDP growth. But what I can say is the numbers ‚Äî the data that we have seen just on job growth ‚Äî 390,000 jobs in the month of May ‚Äî what we have seen is historic numbers, is a his- ‚Äî we are in a historic place in history ‚Äî historic place right now, as we have ‚Äî as we look at where we are with the economy. Very, very different than where we were a year ago.
And that is because of what the President has been able to do with a comprehensive plan to get people vaccinated, with a plan to get people back to work.
Remember ‚Äî and I know some of you know this ‚Äî schools were closed when he ‚Äî when he entered the administration. Businesses were closed when he entered the administration. The economy was in crisis. We are in a different place. That‚Äôs what ‚Äî that‚Äôs how we see this.
Q One quick one. Are we in a recession then? Because the Atlanta Fed GDP now looks at a snapshot, and it‚Äôs 0.9 percent. It‚Äôs gone down from 1.9 to 1.3 for the second quarter. Two quarters in a row of negative growth is a recession. So are we there? And how close ‚Äî
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, the way that we see it is we have the right tools, and we are in a strong place to continue to get ‚Äî to get our ‚Äî to be in this transition where we have stable ‚Äî stable growth. And that is what‚Äôs important. And so, that‚Äôs going to be our focus.
Q Thank you. Will you follow up?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Thank you, guys. I actually ‚Äî I do have to go. I really do have to go.

Emory Healthcare's Community Breakfast series is hosted by Jen Schuck, CEO of Emory Decatur Hospital, Emory Hillandale Hospital and Emory Long-Term Acute Care. Our Nutrition Services Manager, Kristen Avera, spoke alongside other experts in the field of diabetes care and education to address some of the challenges and opportunities for individuals living with diabetes. 

The panel acknowledged the stigma and challenges around diabetes care but also spoke to solutions for these barriers and the opportunities to empower those living with diabetes. We look forward to seeing how more conversations with the community can help to further our mission of providing medically tailored meals and nutrition education to empower Georgians to prevent and manage diabetes.

#NutritionForAll #FoodIsMedicine #FoodIsLove"," Hi, I'm Matt Piper. I'm proud to serve as the Executive Director of Open Hand Atlanta. From our Midtown kitchen, our team cooks, packages up and delivers over 5,000 meals a day. Plus, we're doing nutrition counseling and nutrition education all throughout Metro Atlanta to help people understand the connection between really good food and positive good health outcomes. We can help people better manage chronic disease or prevent it in the first place. Through all of our nutrition services, it's a proud mission indeed. My name is Katie McKenzie and I serve as the Director of Development here at Open Hand. My day to day, I work on raising the philanthropic funds needed to make sure that we can make our mission a reality. And thanks to you, we're able to serve those around our community on a daily basis by producing 5,000 meals a day out of our Midtown kitchen. My role as the Senior Manager of Alter Services is to ensure that we have enough volunteers to help us take out the routes each day, as well as pack meals in our packing area. We couldn't do this work without people like you helping us each day on campus, as well as through your generous donations. So thank you so much for giving back. This time last year, I didn't, I was able to do a lot for myself, but since I've done some health issues, then delivering my meals has really come in handy. Having that interaction, like I said with the volunteers for a few minutes, once a week is fun, because they're very, very kind and sweet people. And it's just been a blessing. You know, to make the magic happen here at OpenHand, it takes a lot of support. And I am so deeply grateful to all of our donors and all of our volunteers who engage with us. Your generosity and your caring is what makes the magic happen. I truly am grateful for all the support that we receive. From the bottom of our hearts, OpenHand Atlanta thanks you, our generous donors and our wonderful volunteers, for making the work that we do on a daily basis possible. We are grateful, but know that more importantly, the clients that we serve, they thank you. Last year was an incredible year for OpenHand, and we actually served more people than in any previous year of our history. That's such a rewarding experience and feeling to know that we can be there for people who need our help. And we of course couldn't do that without our volunteers and our donors. I'm so deeply grateful to each and every one of them. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",no longer populated,,2021-12-31T12:01:25.000Z,post data removed,,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,

Listen as he talks about why this event is so important to Open Hand Atlanta, particularly after the challenges of 2020. 

Want to see more of Chris Hall and our other incredible star chefs while benefitting our neighbors in need? Buy your tickets today and join us at Party in the Kitchen on September 30th by visiting the link in our bio and clicking ""Party in the Kitchen,"" or at partyinthekitchen.org"," Hi, my name is Butch Whitfield and I'm here with Open Handed Landed to tell you a little bit about this year's party in the kitchen. Right now I'm here to introduce to you one of our famous faces who's going to be cooking for you this year. Now Chris Hall beside me right here. Now he is known for as the local chef here in Buckhead for local three. So I have here Louisa Bazarati and she's going to talk to Chris and ask him a little bit more about what we can expect this year. Chris it's delightful to be with you. Good to see you. I've known Chris a long long time since he was a wee Mr. Fist boy and now he's a grown-up Mr. Fist chef. And we're so lucky to have you of course is one of the stars of party in the kitchen and the stars of the Atlanta culinary scene. So tell me how you got started with party in the kitchen and Open Handed. So those many years ago. Yeah it was a few years ago now. For those of you that don't know there's an Open Hand Mafia, Louisa's part of this but Jerry Klaskella who I used to work for in Kevin Rathman called me and said you're doing this and it sort of just took life from there and then you then Helen Carlos called and the rest as they say is history and if I'm one of the faces of this whole thing we need to like figure out a better sort of thing. Absolutely not. From Wells hair that can represent Open Hand like my face now that's not going to be I wish I had Crumb Wells hair that would be awesome too but you are one of the faces but mostly you're one of the hearts behind party in the kitchen. One of the reasons I love Chris Hall is not only is he amazingly talented and we're going to talk about the food you're going to prepare for us but he has a huge heart and has been incredibly generous to open hand and just so many charities plus you can't say no to Helen Carlos right am I right about that. So what are we serving us at party in the kitchen? So I think we're going to do steam buns like kind of Bocham style so in Asian style steam bun we always try and vary it up every year and do something fun it's such a cool event and I love the fact that we see new people but we also see the same people and so we get to know people and they kind of know us and we can surprise them and give them something different because you don't want to you know go to the same thing two years in a row. It's always always always delicious at chef Chris Hall's table but also this year's extra special we didn't get together last year so how does that make you feel? Yeah it's so nice to be able to get out and see people and feel the energy in a room like we're going to have and just like that lifts you up and we're doing good and so many people during COVID this has been a struggle it's been a struggle for individuals and the people that the charity serves but it's also been a struggle for the charity right? Like all of us had to take a break it's different raising money it's different doing all the things that we do as a charity and so this year it's incredibly important not only to get together but to sort of reinvent and show a renewed vigor for this mission and what we're doing and have some joy right it's going to be great to have some joy together. Yeah that's a fun that's a fun room every year. We've got lots of energy to share with you this year this is partying the kitchen September 30th we look forward to seeing you there. See you guys there thanks. Ciao.",no longer populated,,2021-08-23T12:21:18.000Z,post data removed,,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,

As it turns out, a global pandemic can either bring you to your knees or can challenge you to adapt quickly so you can respond to meet the increased need in the community. So we adapted, we forged ahead, and for the last five months, we never said no. We said yes to more people throughout Georgia and our entire need of our services. To more seniors who continue to shelter in place indefinitely, to more people with underlying better conditions, most susceptible to COVID-19. To more at-risk families devastated by the health and economic impacts of the pandemic. We said yes, we'll be here for you so you can stay home and you can stay healthy. We prepared and delivered more meals than ever. We began to shift meals for the first time to 39 more counties in rural Georgia. And we helped reach the gaps in our food security safety net with the help of our wonderful donors and community partners. But we still have so much more work to do, work that would not be possible if it were not for the tremendous support that you have provided to help us battle this crisis. We thank you, and we hope you'll continue to help us step up to meet the challenge. So many people rely on Open Hand for the food we provide every day, and we rely on you.

Poultry activities are allowed to resume statewide after a bird flu outbreak in northeast Georgia. üêì

The ban was put in place last month after confirmed bird flu detection at two sites in Elbert County.  The suspension of all live poultry exhibitions, shows and sales is now lifted.  The Georgia Department of Agriculture says the two affected areas remain under quarantine until further notice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to announce that both commercial poultry producers in the control area and poultry enthusiasts across our state can return to normal operations,‚Äù said Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler J Harper. ‚ÄúWhile this announcement is a great step in the right direction, HPAI remains a significant threat to our #1 industry, and the Georgia Department of Agriculture will continue working around the clock to protect our state‚Äôs flocks and to keep prices as low as possible for Georgia consumers.‚Äù

Shortly before midnight last night, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published its initial findings from a study it undertook last July when it asked eight large companies to turn over information about the data they collect about consumers, product sales, and how the surveillance the companies used affected consumer prices. The FTC focused on the middlemen hired by retailers. Those middlemen use algorithms to tweak and target prices to different markets.

The initial findings of the FTC using data from six of the eight companies show that those prices are not static. Middlemen can target prices to individuals using their location, browsing patterns, shopping history, and even the way they move a mouse over a webpage. They can also use that information to show higher-priced products first in web searches. The FTC found that the intermediaries‚Äîthe middlemen‚Äîworked with at least 250 retailers.

‚ÄúInitial staff findings show that retailers frequently use people‚Äôs personal information to set targeted, tailored prices for goods and services‚Äîfrom a person's location and demographics, down to their mouse movements on a webpage,‚Äù said FTC chair Lina Khan. ‚ÄúThe FTC should continue to investigate surveillance pricing practices because Americans deserve to know how their private data is being used to set the prices they pay and whether firms are charging different people different prices for the same good or service.‚Äù

The FTC has asked for public comment on consumers‚Äô experience with surveillance pricing.

FTC commissioner Andrew N. Ferguson, whom Trump has tapped to chair the commission in his incoming administration, dissented from the report. 

Matt Stoller of the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project, which is working ‚Äúto address today‚Äôs crisis of concentrated economic power,‚Äù wrote that ‚Äú[t]he antitrust enforcers (Lina Khan et al) went full Tony Montana on big business this week before Trump people took over.‚Äù 

Stoller made a list. The FTC sued John Deere ‚Äúfor generating $6 billion by prohibiting farmers from being able to repair their own equipment,‚Äù released a report showing that pharmacy benefit managers had ‚Äúinflated prices for specialty pharmaceuticals by more than $7 billion,‚Äù ‚Äúsued corporate landlord Greystar, which owns 800,000 apartments, for misleading renters on junk fees,‚Äù and ‚Äúforced health care private equity powerhouse Welsh Carson to stop monopolization of the anesthesia market.‚Äù 

It sued Pepsi for conspiring to give Walmart exclusive discounts that made prices higher at smaller stores, ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äã[l]eft a roadmap for parties who are worried about consolidation in AI by big tech by revealing a host of interlinked relationships among Google, Amazon and Microsoft and Anthropic and OpenAI,‚Äù said gig workers can‚Äôt be sued for antitrust violations when they try to organize, and forced game developer Cognosphere to pay a $20 million fine for marketing loot boxes to teens under 16 that hid the real costs and misled the teens.  

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ‚Äúsued Capital One for cheating consumers out of $2 billion by misleading consumers over savings accounts,‚Äù Stoller continued. It ‚Äúforced Cash App purveyor Block‚Ä¶to give $120 million in refunds for fostering fraud on its platform and then refusing to offer customer support to affected consumers,‚Äù ‚Äúsued Experian for refusing to give consumers a way to correct errors in credit reports,‚Äù ordered Equifax to pay $15 million to a victims‚Äô fund for ‚Äúfailing to properly investigate errors on credit reports,‚Äù and ordered ‚ÄúHonda Finance to pay $12.8 million for reporting inaccurate information that smeared the credit reports of Honda and Acura drivers.‚Äù

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice sued ‚Äúseven giant corporate landlords for rent-fixing, using the software and consulting firm RealPage,‚Äù Stoller went on. It ‚Äúsued $600 billion private equity titan KKR for systemically misleading the government on more than a dozen acquisitions.‚Äù

‚ÄúHonorary mention goes to [Secretary Pete Buttigieg] at the Department of Transportation for suing Southwest and fining Frontier for ‚Äòchronically delayed flights,‚Äô‚Äù Stoller concluded. He added more results to the list in his newsletter BIG.

Meanwhile, last night, while the leaders in the cryptocurrency industry were at a ball in honor of President-elect Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Trump launched his own cryptocurrency. By morning he appeared to have made more than $25 billion, at least on paper. According to Eric Lipton at the New York Times, ‚Äúethics experts assailed [the business] as a blatant effort to cash in on the office he is about to occupy again.‚Äù

Adav Noti, executive director of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, told Lipton: ‚ÄúIt is literally cashing in on the presidency‚Äîcreating a financial instrument so people can transfer money to the president‚Äôs family in connection with his office. It is beyond unprecedented.‚Äù Cryptocurrency leaders worried that just as their industry seems on the verge of becoming mainstream, Trump‚Äôs obvious cashing-in would hurt its reputation. Venture capitalist Nick Tomaino posted: ‚ÄúTrump owning 80 percent and timing launch hours before inauguration is predatory and many will likely get hurt by it.‚Äù

Yesterday the European Commission, which is the executive arm of the European Union, asked X, the social media company owned by Trump-adjacent billionaire Elon Musk, to hand over internal documents about the company‚Äôs algorithms that give far-right posts and politicians more visibility than other political groups. The European Union has been investigating X since December 2023 out of concerns about how it deals with the spread of disinformation and illegal content. The European Union‚Äôs Digital Services Act regulates online platforms to prevent illegal and harmful activities, as well as the spread of disinformation. 

Today in Washington, D.C., the National Mall was filled with thousands of people voicing their opposition to President-elect Trump and his policies. Online speculation has been rampant that Trump moved his inauguration indoors to avoid visual comparisons between today‚Äôs protesters and inaugural attendees. Brutally cold weather also descended on President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2009 inauguration, but a sea of attendees nonetheless filled the National Mall. 

Trump has always understood the importance of visuals and has worked hard to project an image of an invincible leader. Moving the inauguration indoors takes away that image, though, and people who have spent thousands of dollars to travel to the capital to see his inauguration are now unhappy to discover they will be limited to watching his motorcade drive by them. On social media, one user posted: ‚ÄúMAGA doesn‚Äôt realize the symbolism of [Trump] moving the inauguration inside: The billionaires, millionaires and oligarchs will be at his side, while his loyal followers are left outside in the cold. Welcome to the next 4+ years.‚Äù 

Trump is not as good at governing as he is at performance: his approach to crises is to blame Democrats for them. But he is about to take office with majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, putting responsibility for governance firmly into his hands. 

Right off the bat, he has at least two major problems at hand. 

Last night, Commissioner Tyler Harper of the Georgia Department of Agriculture suspended all ‚Äúpoultry exhibitions, shows, swaps, meets, and sales‚Äù until further notice after officials found Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or bird flu, in a commercial flock. As birds die from the disease or are culled to prevent its spread, the cost of eggs is rising‚Äîjust as Trump, who vowed to reduce grocery prices, takes office. 

There have been 67 confirmed cases of the bird flu in the U.S. among humans who have caught the disease from birds. Most cases in humans are mild, but public health officials are watching the virus with concern because bird flu variants are unpredictable. On Friday, outgoing Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra announced $590 million in funding to Moderna to help speed up production of a vaccine that covers the bird flu. Juliana Kim of NPR explained that this funding comes on top of $176 million that Health and Human Services awarded to Moderna last July.  

The second major problem is financial. On Friday, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen wrote to congressional leaders to warn them that the Treasury would hit the debt ceiling on January 21 and be forced to begin using extraordinary measures in order to pay outstanding obligations and prevent defaulting on the national debt. Those measures mean the Treasury will stop paying into certain federal retirement accounts as required by law, expecting to make up that difference later.

Yellen reminded congressional leaders: ‚ÄúThe debt limit does not authorize new spending, but it creates a risk that the federal government might not be able to finance its existing legal obligations that Congresses and Presidents of both parties have made in the past.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúI respectfully urge Congress to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.‚Äù

Both the avian flu and the limits of the debt ceiling must be managed, and managed quickly, and solutions will require expertise and political skill. 

Rather than offering their solutions to these problems, the Trump team leaked that it intended to begin mass deportations on Tuesday morning in Chicago, choosing that city because it has large numbers of immigrants and because Trump‚Äôs people have been fighting with Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat. Michelle Hackman, Joe Barrett, and Paul Kiernan of the Wall Street Journal, who broke the story, reported that Trump‚Äôs people had prepared to amplify their efforts with the help of right-wing media.

But once the news leaked of the plan and undermined the ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù the administration wanted, Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúborder czar‚Äù Tom Homan said the team was reconsidering it.", ,no longer populated,,2025-01-19T05:05:26.000Z,post data removed,,59548.0,25539.0,4121.0,0.0,,,

Governor Brian Kemp has suspended the gas tax as of yesterday.  This will save you about .30 cents per gallon of gas and about .33 cents per gallon of diesel.

Both Cook and Colquitt are eligible for FEMA Individual Assistance and Public Assistance.  As far as individual assistance, in most cases, your insurance will be primary coverage and the individual assistance can cover any gaps.  Find more info at https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual. It outlines eligibility and criteria.  There will likely be more information coming on this topic so please keep it on your radar screen.

While still determining Ag commodity damages locally and to the east of us, there are some things in the works from U.S. Department of Agriculture, Georgia Department of Agriculture, and other agencies.  Check with your local FSA offices for more information; most of it will be to the benefit of our growers and producers.  Appreciate the work of our Ag Commissioner Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and Georgia Forestry Commission, and others in spotlighting the amount of unprecedented damage to our state's top industry.  There will likely be more updates on this at the state level in the near future as well.

There are still a good many of our citizens without power.  In the past on military deployments, I have lived for several weeks without power or running water but that was in a combat zone.  From what I have seen and heard, the conditions for our neighbors east of us are very similar.  I know from speaking to them directly that our utility companies are at the edge of their capabilities and are doing all they can to get power back. Updates are available at Colquitt Electric Membership Corporation, Georgia Power, and your city utility departments.

Thank you to all the private, non-profit, public, and neighbor to neighbor assistance that is going on, seen and unseen. It has been an inspiration to us. #Helene", ,no longer populated,,2024-10-04T16:17:32.000Z,post data removed,,53.0,19.0,7.0,0.0,,,

When Hurricane Helene came through, she decided she liked Moses Pecans and took them with her. We are at a 80% total tree loss across all orchards. Our younger (10 and under) orchards seemed to weather the storm better and that is our 20% left but as we all know they will not produce for another few years. 

But on a much brighter note, Commissioner Tyler Harper is the definition of boots on the ground, ""What can we do?"". He visited the farm today to help assess damage and start advocating for farmers in our area. We can't thank him enough, in a time like this it means a lot to see him out doing everything he can.  And in the words of Governor Kemp, all we can do now is ""Keep Plowing"".

When does the Farmers Market open this year? We can‚Äôt wait! A. The Union County Farmers Market is scheduled to open June 1 this year. The hours will be 8am to 1pm on Saturdays and 9am to 1pm on Tuesdays. We are looking forward to another busy season this year with many return vendors and some new additions. For more information, you can visit their website at www.ucfarmersmarket.com or you can call them at 706-439-6043. Q. Can I bring my dog to the Farmers Market? A. If you would like to bring your dog, the Humane Society‚Äôs Mountain Shelter has volunteers there offering pet sitting for a donation to the shelter, however there are no pets allowed under the covered area of the Farmers Market, with the exception of legitimate service dogs. This is because of safety regulations pertaining to the sale of food. It is the same reason you cannot take your dog into the grocery store. Q. I grow tomatoes and peppers in my back yard. Can I rent a booth at the Farmers Market this year? A. Many of the current vendors return year after year. This means that very few booths come available each season. Locals looking to schedule a booth for a season can download a copy of the application from the Union County Government website or can call or drop by the Farmers Market. A few spaces are left available each season for walk-up vendors. Walk-up vendors can obtain a space on a first-come first served basis. Preference is given to agricultural products. Q. What can be sold at the Union County Farmers Market? A. All vendors must meet and abide by license requirements from the Georgia Department of Agriculture, the Union County Health Department as well as those required by the USDA. Vendors can sell food in its raw or natural state including fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs, honey, USDA-approved meat, candied eggs. Bedding plants and potted plants grown from seed, plugs, cuttings, bulbs, and bare root. Woody plants and bedding plants may be re-potted and sold if they have been in the seller‚Äôs possession for 45 days (no resale of pre-finished plants is allowed). Fresh cut flowers and cultivated mushrooms are permitted if grown by the vendor on their property. No foraged items are permitted. B. Value-Added Agricultural Products are those grown by a vendor and modified/enhanced by the same vendor such as cheese, cider, dog treats, fiber products, etc. Vendors selling these types of products must have any applicable licenses from the Georgia Department of Agriculture (ie Dairy or Feed Licenses) and meet all federal, state and local regulations. C. Pre-packaged foods prepared by any process other than washing such as breads, rolls, biscuits, cakes, pastries, jams, granola, etc., can be sold. These must be prepared from scratch meaning there shall be nothing sold using commercially prepared mixes, crusts/shells, or fillings. Vendors selling these products must package, label, and have a Cottage Food License in accordance with the Georgia Department of Agriculture and meet all federal, state and local regulations. A full list of product qualifications is available online at: ucfarmersmarket.com Q. Can non-food items be sold at the Union County Farmers Market? A. All crafts are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. They shall be a product of a home or cottage type industry and include handmade soap (not produced by a farmer), woodworking, pottery, quilted/knitted/crocheted products, jewelry, cutlery, candles etc. Members selling these items must have created them. The items must be handcrafted, original, and exhibit a high level of quality and design. Q. When is the Trash to Treasures open at the Farmers Market? A. Trash to Treasures is open every Friday from May 20 ‚Äì October 14. It is open to customers from 8am to 1:00pm. Vendors can begin to set up at 6:30am and must be packed up and exited the market by 2:00pm. Q. What items can be sold at the Trash to Treasures sales? A. Anything can be sold including crafts, new items for resale and gently used items. Generally, food items are not sold at the Trash to Treasures weekly event. There are a few things which cannot be sold. These items include home canned foods, produce, and other food items. Also, people selling plants must obtain a live plant license from the Georgia Department of Agriculture.", ,no longer populated,,2024-04-13T11:01:24.000Z,post data removed,,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,

So recently, peanut growers from Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi gathered
at the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort for the annual Southern Peanut Growers Conference. Needless to say, it was quite the gathering. Damon Jones was there and reports on the challenges
growers face at both the state and national levels as they gear up for the upcoming harvest
season. [Destin, Florida/ Damon Jones ‚Äì Reporting]
While Sandestin might be a spot for those looking for a little fun in the sun, it recently
played host to a conference highlighting one of Georgia&#39;s staple crops, the peanut. Here at the Southern Peanut Growers Conference,
producers got an opportunity to hear from experts, share ideas with fellow growers and
get a fresh perspective about the industry. [Joe Boddiford ‚Äì Chairman, GA Peanut Commission]
We&#39;re bringing in a wider array of speakers. We&#39;re trying to reach out into other areas
that sometimes we&#39;re not thinking about. We have our county production meetings. We have a state production meeting in Georgia
every year. And that gets you the basic knowledge on the
production and all of that. But sometimes we need to think outside the
box. And this is an opportunity to do it. [Damon]
That&#39;s exactly what longtime Congressman Austin Scott encouraged the growers to do, as he
discussed an overlooked aspect when it comes to negotiating the new Farm Bill in Washington. [Rep. Austin Scott ‚Äì (R) Georgia, 8th District]

own it. The seed companies want to own it. Uh, ultimately, I believe it should belong
to the farmer. Now, if the farmer decides that they want
to contract that data out, that&#39;s an asset of the farmer and they&#39;ve got the right to
do that. But, you know, we have to be having an honest
discussion about who owns the data on the production on our farm. And that I hope will uh, be referenced in
the farm bill. [Damon]
However, that isn&#39;t the only issue being talked about in the nation&#39;s capital, as farmers
are being put at more risk than ever due to a drop in spending on our nation&#39;s food security. [Austin]
We only spend about one quarter of one percent of our total federal spending on the risk
management practices for, for our farmers. And so, uh, as a country that&#39;s a, that&#39;s
a very small amount. It, it puts a tremendous amount of risk on
the backs of the family farm. Uh, if reference prices and other things don&#39;t
move to give those farm families uh, more of a backstop if commodity prices fall, uh,
we, we stand the risk of vast bankruptcies throughout rural America. And that&#39;s something that would be devastating
for our country and our food supply. [Damon Jones/ Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort]
With that smaller safety net and the ever-increasing price of production, opening up new and untapped
markets has become a priority for the University of Georgia and their peanut research team. [Nino Brown ‚Äì Peanut Breeder, UGA]
One of the ways we can do that is by increasing the oil content of the peanuts as a potential
oil market for peanut growers to uh, participate in. The overall goal is to develop a uh, a dedicated,
high oil peanut cultivar um, that will make a, a potential grower just as much money on
the oil market as they would make on those uh, same acres in the edible peanut market. [Damon]
With those acres potentially going towards the high oleic varieties, that could improve
the grower&#39;s bottom line on two different fronts. [Nino]
Um, we want to uh, try to improve uh, really two markets at the same time. So, improve the prices they&#39;re getting on
their edible peanuts and then hopefully uh, also get some additional revenue from their
oil uh, high oil peanuts. You know, profitability is always number one
and diversity is also a really important component of sustainability. Um, and so, we&#39;re trying to address both of
those things with our efforts. [Damon]
Reporting from the 2023 Southern Peanut Growers Conference in Destin, Florida, I&#39;m Damon Jones
for the Farm Monitor. [KENNY]
Considering it accounts for nearly fifteen billion dollars annually towards the state&#39;s
economy, the turfgrass industry here in Georgia is one of the biggest in the country as more
than one-point-eight million acres contributes to lawns, golf courses, and other landscapes. Our John Holcomb reports from Wilcox County
on one operation that&#39;s been cutting quality sod for more than twenty years. [Abbeville/John Holcomb-Reporting]
Here in South Georgia, this turfgrass operation is hard at work harvesting some fresh sod
that will most likely make its way to Atlanta and transform someone&#39;s yard. This of course is nothing new for them as
it&#39;s something they&#39;ve been doing for more than two decades since getting their start
in the industry. [Chris McIntyre/Vice President, McIntyre Turf]
Majority of what we grow goes to metro-Atlanta area. So, if Atlanta sneezes, I guess we catch a
cold. So, we keep up with what is happening in the
Atlanta market. A lot of great customers, but it&#39;s taken us
about twenty-three years to pare down and get the great group of customers that we have
right now. We got some regular customers and then others
that just call in, maybe homeowners or uh, you know contractors that are interested uh,
in our products in our Bermudas and our zoysias. [John]
Over the years, they&#39;ve worked hard to expand their customer base and to expand their operation
by adding new production acres, crew members, equipment, and new varieties of grass. [Burt Bynum/Owner, McIntyre Turf]
We&#39;ve grown from starting out with one small field of twenty-five acres, one pivot and
kind of added on each year. Tried to add a pivot and twenty-five, thirty
acres. We started with a small crew with a manual
sod harvester uh, now we have two automated sod harvesters, uh, much larger crew uh, trucking
has improved greatly, we&#39;ve got a nice fleet of trucks that haul our sod regularly. [Chris]
Well of course we&#39;ve grown our acreage and then uh, we&#39;ve gone through and uh and a lot
of customers that we&#39;ve added uh, trying to get a good fit you know, we have to work well
with our customers and they have to work well with us and we have to know what their business
is, uh and so we feel like we&#39;re, we feel like we&#39;ve been successful there and that
has taken a good twenty three years to do. [John]
However, a growing operation also means more opportunity for challenges, like with costs
of inputs such as fuel and fertilizer, but they say the main challenge is mother nature,
as this Spring was unusually cold and caused their grass to nearly stop growing. [Burt]
This past year, uh, we had a good growing season, um, as winter came in, everything
was good, started warming up early, our grass started growing and then it got cool in March
and April and even in May, um, really cooled off for us, so it almost kind of put a halt
to our growing uh, trying to grow our sod back to where we could harvest it. [John]
According to Chris, there&#39;s one more challenge, and that&#39;s their water, as they can&#39;t grow
grass without it , which is why they rely heavily on irrigation systems and say they
couldn&#39;t operate without them. [Chris]
The uh, things we can&#39;t control really are the water and uh, temperature. And both of those are important for growing
grasses. Particularly our warm season grasses and then
uh, if we didn&#39;t have these irrigation systems and a good water source, uh, we have ground
water and surface water uh, that we are able to draw from, but we couldn&#39;t do what we do
without this irrigation. Anytime we do add new acreage, it&#39;s a must. It&#39;s got to have a way to put water on it. [John]
Reporting in Abbeville for the Farm Monitor, I&#39;m John Holcomb. [KENNY]
After The break; from ensuring food safety, to investigating animal cruelty, labor trafficking,
and even agro-terrorism. Harlan Proveaux and his team are on a mission
to protect Georgia&#39;s Ag Industry. [Music] [Music]
[Lamar Black] Hi, I&#39;m Lamar Black from Jenkins County, and
I&#39;m a second-generation farmer. Been farming for sixty-two years and we primarily
grow cotton, corn, and peanuts. All of its gone grown conservation tillage
with heavy cover crop. Well, farming is, to me a way of life. It is, but it&#39;s a very good life, but it also
a business. You got to treat it as a business and not
just as a way of life, but to be out here every day, planting, watching things grow,
and then hopefully have a good harvest, that is a very good feeling. Well, first of all, grow about growing peanuts. I like to eat &#39;em &lt;laugh&gt;, particularly in
the boiling stage. But, uh, they, they&#39;re a crop that is challenging
to grow because of the many diseases that can get on them when all the weed control,
but they are a forgiving crop. I have had peanuts to, in, uh, trolley in
situations situation to, I would think they would never make anything because it had been
so dry and you couldn&#39;t get a good rain. I mean, a good rain, enough to wet the soil
well, two to three inches of rain and peanuts will rebound, make a yield. You just can&#39;t imagine. Well, the advice I would have for a farmer,
a young farmer that was starting out, was to realize upfront you going to have some
long hours, sometimes, not, fortunately, not every day, but, uh, you&#39;re gonna have some
long hours to put in. You, it&#39;s very expensive to farm. Even to buy land is very expensive now, and
to grow a crop, it become more expensive than it&#39;s ever been. But the reward is great when you can come
in, in late fall or early fall when you harvest a crop and then you find out that you&#39;ve got
a good crop and you&#39;ve got, and that, and that the, uh, you going to be in the black
on the, uh, profitable side of peanuts. Probably wondering why I&#39;ve been doing it
for sixty two years. But I, I, I enjoy it. I like what I do. I like to see.... I&#39;m out in mother nature every day, and I
like that. It&#39;s just rewarding to see, put a little small
seed in the ground and watch it grow to maturity and produce. Many times what you, the seed that you planted
was re-produced many times, and it is just all rewarding and you&#39;re so close to nature. [Music]
[RAY] In case you missed it, The Georgia Department
of Agriculture is now officially a Law Enforcement agency once again. Back in June, Commissioner Tyler Harper made
the announcement, appointing Harlan Proveaux as the new Inspector General, and Director
of the Law Enforcement &amp; Emergency Management Division. Commissioner Harper praising Proveaux&#39;s extensive
experience in both Law Enforcement and Emergency Management, while also expressing full support
and confidence in rebuilding this crucial division within the Department. Now recently, I had a chance to chat with
Director Proveaux about his new role, its significance for Georgia Agriculture, and
how it will directly impact our hardworking farmers and producers. [Music]
[Ray] I have to be honest; I don&#39;t think a lot of
people were familiar with the law enforcement division of the Georgia Department of Agriculture. It&#39;s really new to a lot of people. So let&#39;s start with your position. What are gonna be some of your main responsibilities? [Harlan Proveaux/GDA Inspector General/Director
of the Law Enforcement &amp; Emergency Management Division]
Sure. So I, you know, you, you, you gotta understand
that that agriculture is, is Georgia&#39;s number one industry. And, uh, I&#39;m responsible for assessing, uh,
the personnel and, and, uh, local and state federal agencies to ensure, uh, food safety,
investigate those cases, uh, involving animal cruelty and drugs and labor trafficking and
agro-terrorism, uh, and, and investigation of deceptive trade practices that people may
be, uh, committing against our farmers or agriculture industry in Georgia. [Ray]
And, and I think that&#39;s the big question too, Harlan, because a lot of people are like,
well, how is this going to be different from say, you know, Georgia DNR or some of those
other, you know, natural resource law enforcement divisions. So, this is really focusing on, you know,
the ag, ag sector, the hardcore ag sector of Georgia. [Director Proveaux]
Absolutely. You know, the, the, when we talk about labor
trafficking, you know, the, the, uh, migrant workers that come to Georgia, uh, that may
be trafficked. You know, we, we, we hear a lot about human
trafficking and labor trafficking is, is a, uh, is a part of human trafficking. And in agriculture, uh, industry is, is huge
with that, uh, with that labor trafficking. We wanna ensure that, that, that doesn&#39;t take
place in, in Georgia, [Ray]
Let&#39;s not forget, there&#39;s another factor that has really played into Georgia Ag, probably
the past, you know, eight, eight years or so. And that&#39;s natural disasters Harlan. Uhh, I don&#39;t know, you know, just, um, early
looking, you know, early glance, the things that you guys have on your plate, how involved
are you going to be in the emergency management plan for, for things like that? for hurricanes and stuff? [Director Proveaux]
Yeah, absolutely. And, and, you know, the, the, the emergency
management side of the house is, is within my division as well. And, uh, we&#39;re working already, uh, on day
one to enhance our response capabilities so we can respond more rapidly and effectively
to, uh, not only natural disasters, but, but, uh, uh, animal disease. You know, Georgia has a tremendous, uh, poultry
industry and, you know, the avian influenza is, is always a threat. Uh, so we&#39;re putting procedures in place now
to, to ensure that we have a rapid, a rapid and, uh, efficient response capability if
either one of those, uh, affects Georgia, uh, whether it be natural disaster or, uh,
an animal disease. And, and one of the things that we&#39;re doing
is, is, uh, developing and, and formalizing our response plans and making sure that they&#39;re
up to date and, uh, uh, that we have the capabilities to respond efficiently. [Ray]
Yeah. And last but not least, the, the, the biggest
advice, request, um, words of encouragement or wisdom you would have for Georgia farmers. Would it be, be patient, we will be there
for you, &lt;laugh&gt;, give us time to get this thing together. Would that be the biggest message that you
have to Georgia&#39;s farmers? [Director Proveaux]
Yeah, and I think one of our responsibilities, and, and we&#39;ve already talked about this in
house and, and Commissioner Harper&#39;s very, uh, very aggressive with making sure that,
uh, we keep our farmers not only, uh, in the loop, uh, with communications when, when,
uh, these, these types of events take place, but we wanna educate them. We want to educate them on our response plans. We want to educate, we want to involve them,
uh, and, and also let them know, uh, what our capabilities are and how we can assist
them, uh, during these times. Whether that be with, with, uh, uh, financial
plans through the federal government or getting reimbursements in these federally disaster,
uh, disasters, uh, whatever that may be, technical assistance, um, uh, response with, with, uh,
companion animal, uh, shelters, whatever the response may be. We wanna make sure, uh, that the farmers know
what our capabilities are and we keep them in the loop with communications during these
times. [Music]

[KENNY] Well finally this week; with input prices
up across the board, it&#39;s vital that farmers maximize their efficiency in the field in
order to turn a profit. As Damon Jones reports, this is where the
UGA Water Efficiency Team comes into play. [Midville/Damon Jones ‚Äì Reporting]
No matter if it&#39;s corn, cotton or peanuts, the one thing each of these Georgia staples
need is sufficient water during growing season. And with rainfall being so unpredictable during
the summer, farmers must rely on irrigation to fill in the gaps. However, the amount can sometimes be tricky,
which is why having the UGA Water Efficiency Team to lean on can provide a little piece
of mind. [Jason Mallard ‚Äì Area Ag Water Agent, UGA]
So, we&#39;re trying to hit that sweet spot, putting in irrigation um, soil moisture sensors, helping
farmers with different types of irrigation and water management tools such as the smart
irrigation apps. We are working with them on um, some of the
different models and that kind of thing that we have. [Damon]
Getting that information comes from numerous tests done on a variety of different soils. [Jason]
There are some pivots in Southwest Georgia that we&#39;re working with where we have in the
neighborhood of um, fifteen, twenty different, individual plots under one pivot with multiple
sensors uh, we have two to three reps for each treatment under one pivot where we&#39;re
able to define that spot where we get the highest yield for the least amount of water
applied. [Damon]
It&#39;s not just research this team specializes in, but also the implementation, as they provide
expertise in the field as well as a pathway for growers to try out this new technology. [Jason]
There&#39;s new technology coming out every year that we are um, trying to help the farmers
and help them install and learn this new technology. Um, that part of what the Ag Water Team is
trying to do. We&#39;re going out and putting these practices
on the farm with the farmers at little to no cost for them to be able to try this new
technology and see how it works on their farm and get to um, experience that without much
investment. [Damon]
And this couldn&#39;t come at a better time as budgets are being tightened due to the ever-increasing
price of production. [Jason]
With input costs being as high as they are and um, even diesel prices being kike they
are, it&#39;s very important to have, to be able to apply water only when is needed. And that is also conserving pumping costs
and conserving our state water resources. So, yes, we can definitely have impact with
this throughout, throughout their farm if they apply this technology. And it does, it varies for um, the input costs,
yes, you pretty much get what you pay for when you use this technology. [Damon]
Even if some farmers aren&#39;t quite ready to implement this new technology, they are still
encouraged to have a plan for their water use heading into the planting season. [Jason]
From the lowest input, such as a checkbook method, all the way up to um, some of our
sensors, which re twenty-five hundred dollars per location within the field, just pick some
type of irrigation water management strategy and go with it. [Damon]
Reporting from Burke County, I&#39;m Damon Jones for the Farm Monitor. [KENNY]
WELL DAMON THANKS SO MUCH, AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS SHOW POSSIBLE. [RAY]

Greetings on state representative Mandisha A. Thomas of the 65th district of the Georgia House of Georgia House of the 65th district of the Georgia states of Georgia. We are in beautiful south fulton county today at your fair farms. We are having my inaugural event of the Cal Fed is designed to increase the literacy rate in the state of Georgia. Just a few moments you will be able to see the jam packed activities in the state of Georgia. Our mission is to help increase the Georgia literacy rate of second and third graders through agriculture vocabulary and farming. Hey y'all my name is Madison Dysar and I am an intern at the Georgia Department of Ag and Commissioner Tyler Harper's office. We are out here today at representing the Mandisha Thomas' Ag Literacy Camp in south fulton. We are so excited to be here and we hope that this is an educational experience for students to learn about the Georgia's top tank modenies and the agricultural industry that is our number one industry and we plan to keep it that way. Greetings and welcome to your fake farm. I'm Patrick Muhammad, the principal farmer and this is Lish Tardemahamit, known as the teacher farmer. And we're excited for you all to be in your fake farm for agri-litus. We are so happy that state representative Mandisha Thomas is considering your fake farm to launch this agri-litus for Georgia in 2023. We're excited to have the children and we're going to wow them today with literacy and agriculture. Stay tuned. Our goal is to offer AGR literacy classes for seven and eight-year-old students whose literacy rate is below average. To bring the students together to learn in an outdoor farm setting through agriculture. Hey guys, how are you? Good. Did you have fun at today's agri-litus.c camp? Yes. Did you learn? Yes. What did you learn? I learned that a tree can make many things out of it as wood. It can make food for it. It can make a piano and it can make wood in it. So I learned, I learned to try to make a ballad. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. What do you think is in there? Come on, give me a ball. This is a small right here. Did the principal farmer teach you how to do that today? Yes. The objectives are to teach 15 to 20 new agriculture words that students can speak, spell, write and draw. 20 kids from across Georgia experience the agri-lituracy amp for kids. The say sad on barrels of hay instead of chairs. They ate fresh fruit and fruit popsicles as they learned how to grow fresh basil and how long it takes for a chicken to grow. Students learned from five teachers across 12 hours during the two day camp, gleaming from each instructor's expertise. Hey guys, where are you going? To Chicago. To Hawaii. Chicago to Hawaii. What did you all think about the camp? There we go. What did you all think about today's camp? Agri-lituracy camp for kids. I'm very good. I'm ready to write. Do you think you learned anything? Do you think you learned anything? I learned it. You did put water in the soil and put sun. I learned it outside. And what did you learn, sir? Yes. I learned the red berries are sour and blue berries. Wow. So I'm going to let you guys go on the Chicago. You guys have a great time, okay? See ya! Children activities. Horticulture. The science of gardening. Dendrology. The studying of trees. Horseback riding. How everyday products like deodorants are tied to agriculture through beeswax. Picked raspberries and at yellow cucumbers. Planting and seeding. Learning how to raise livestock and even scooping poop. Plus much, much more. Hi, I'm Rocky. This is Ethan. I'm a family from one of our biggest local fields. It's that everybody, agriculture and literacy. I smell happy to be here and engage in educational science. I'm going to join agriculture as well as local farm and farm culture practices. And when it comes out, the support was feeling that it was a great advantage.

But instead of celebrating, the child spent the day in bed mourning the loss of the family's two dogs the day before.

""They're extremely distraught,‚Äù Loftin said. ‚ÄúI mean, there was nothing to prepare them for the loss of these animals.‚Äù

Those dogs were among 11 that died in a house fire in Dalton, Georgia, late last week. All 11 of the dogs were being boarded at the Barks and Bubbles Grooming Salon. But how did they wind up at a home roughly 10 miles away? We spent Monday digging deeper for answers.

""They would read to these dogs and tell stories to them,"" Lofton said.

Nothing prepared Lofton and her sons for the sudden loss of their dogs while they were on vacation.

""My heart just fell to the pit of my stomach,"" she said. ""When we got back to the condo where my other family was at, I told them, and my oldest son just started screaming. And my youngest son just started running.""

Lofton dropped her dogs off at Barks and Bubbles, a pet groomer that also boards dogs. The dogs were staying inside a home when it caught fire. ""I was confused, and I'm angry that it happened,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI'm angry at the individuals that I left my dogs with.‚Äù

According to the Whitfield County Fire Department, the fire occurred Friday afternoon. When crews arrived, they found 11 dogs deceased.

""Had they been there, they would still be alive. So, I blame them for this happening,"" said Lofton.

Barks and Bubbles shared video of dogs playing outside on their Facebook page on July 1. The post has since been removed. The Georgia Department of Agriculture told us Barks and Bubbles was last inspected on June 15 and passed. But they told us the business' license expired on June 30. Licensees normally have a 10-day grace period to renew without penalty. As of now, we do not know if the business is renewing its license.

""It's not the way I wanted my son's birthday to turn out. And it is not the way I wanted the summer to go,"" Lofton said.

The Fire Department tells us there's still no word on the house fire's cause, and they say they did not have the equipment to rescue pets from the burning home.", ,no longer populated,,2023-07-11T23:45:08.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT3hjWkE0PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--877be55068b0b81974f36428bd762f5dab9967c6/post-1362701-137821449-thumbnail,137.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,,,

The ACCGov Animal Services Department at 125 Buddy Christian Way will not accept owner-surrendered cats for intake until July 20, 2023, due to confirmed cases of feline panleukopenia, also called pan leuk, FP, or feline parvo. Dog and stray cat intakes will continue as normal.

Until July 20, Animal Services will limit cat intakes to stray cats only due to space constraints. Residents seeking to surrender cats prior to July 20 should contact Animal Services by phone at 706-613-3540 for advice.

Owner reclaims of cats will continue, although owners will be advised of a potential exposure to panleukopenia and to contact their vet immediately if their cat starts to act ill. Cat adoptions will also continue in the cat adoption area.

Two litters of kittens tested positive on June 25, 2023, for the feline panleukopenia virus. Animal Services contacted the Georgia Department of Agriculture and reported the results as required.

Animal Shelter staff are continuing to undergo specialized cleaning processes to help minimize the spread of the virus. These steps are being taken to prevent accidental exposure to the virus for cats outside of these shelter areas through dog or human contact.

Due to the facility's design to separate animals into different areas, the dog area of the shelter will remain open for normal operations.

The Georgia General Assembly returned to the State Capitol for the final two days of the 2023 legislative session on Monday, March 27. Then, on Wednesday, March 29, the session came to an end as the House and Senate completed Legislative Day 40, which is also known as ‚ÄúSine Die,‚Äù a Latin term meaning ‚Äúwithout assigning a day for further meeting.‚Äù  (My first Sine Die)

During these two eventful days, my colleagues and I worked late into the night to vote on legislation that will impact communities across our state. 

I will share some of the bills that we voted on from the
Rules calendars, as well as highlight a few House bills that received final passage this week.

Now, all of the bills that received final passage before we adjourned Sine Die will go to Governor Brian Kemp for his final consideration.

Fiscal Year 2024 Budget

Before we adjourned on Sine Die, the state legislature approved a Conference Committee Report for House Bill 19, or the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 2024) budget, fulfilling our one constitutional obligation of the session. Effective July 1, this final version of the FY 2024 budget
is set at a revenue estimate of $32.4 billion, which is $2.2 billion, or 7.4 percent, more than the Fiscal Year 2023 budget. More than 50 percent of this state budget is dedicated toward funding our state‚Äôs K-12 and higher education systems and includes $13.1 billion to fully fund the
Quality Basic Education program and an additional $50.2 million in lottery funds to bring the HOPE factor rate for scholarships and grants up to 100 percent of last year‚Äôs tuition costs. I am also excited to announce that certified teachers and school employees would experience a $2,000 increase to the state base salary schedule through this budget. Nearly a quarter of the FY 2024 budget would go toward health and human services, and within this crucial budget area, we
included $42.2 million for Medicaid reimbursement rate increases for providers. To ensure the House‚Äôs public safety priorities are reflected in this budget, this conference committee report includes $23.5 million for a total compensation increase of $4,000 for more than 3,900 law
enforcement officers across 12 state agencies; front-line state officers would receive an additional $2,000 salary adjustment in certain departments. Finally, almost 10 percent of the FY
2024 budget would go toward economic development and general government services, and seven percent of the budget would support transportation infrastructure improvements. This robust budget is full of bipartisan initiatives, and you can find more highlights from the FY 2024 budget here. HB 19 has now been sent to the governor for his consideration.

Improving Juvenile Court Proceedings/Foster Care System

During Legislative Day 39, we passed a Senate bill to help standardize the process for children who may be taken into the state‚Äôs custody. To help avoid placing children in foster care unnecessarily, Senate Bill 133 would clarify several of Georgia‚Äôs code sections to improve
juvenile court proceedings for children who are in need of services, also known as ‚ÄúCHINS,‚Äù or for child delinquency or dependency proceedings. Under this bill, prior to placing a child in the
custody of the Georgia Division of Family & Children Services (DFCS), the court would first consider what state services have been provided to the child or the parent/guardian or what services may be available to allow the child to remain in their home. A judge would also
consider what efforts have been made to secure the placement of a child other than in custody of DFCS or if a child protective services report was made. After a child is ordered into the custody
of DFCS, the bill would mandate that a preliminary protective hearing take place within 72 hours of the placement and require all parties to provide copies of medical, psychological and educational assessments and reports of the child or the child's parent/guardian to DFCS, which
would give the state more time to act quickly to find a place for a child in need of an alternate living situation. In recent years, the state has struggled to find housing and foster families for children with complex needs, which has resulted in these children staying in hotels and other
temporary spaces. If Gov. Kemp signs this bill into law, DFCS and our court systems could do a better job ensuring that children receive appropriate care, have placement options identified in a
timely manner and, hopefully, provide services that could avoid placing them into foster care altogether.

Water Safety Plans for Swimming Lessons

We also unanimously passed a measure that aims to prevent drowning accidents during swim lessons. Senate Bill 107, or Izzy‚Äôs Law, would require the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) to develop a model safety plan for private swim instructors to utilize by January 1,
2024. This safety plan would include minimum standards for student-to-instructor ratios, secondary supervision recommendations, parent or legal guardian attendance, as well as the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification. Private swim instructors would be required to use DPH's model aquatic safety plan or have their own water safety plan in place by April 1, 2024. Violations of SB 107 would be considered a misdemeanor charge with a minimum fine of $200
for the first and second violation, as well as a $1,000 maximum fine for third and subsequent violations. This legislation is named after Izzy Scott, a four year old boy who drowned on his second day of swimming lessons at a private pool in Georgia. Following the tragic death of this young boy, Izzy‚Äôs family found that our state laws lacked safety standards for these private swim instructors, which initially prevented prosecutors from bringing charges against the instructor.
We were honored to have Izzy‚Äôs family join us in the House gallery this week to watch the passage of this important legislation. If SB 107 is signed into law, Izzy‚Äôs Law would ensure that swim instructors have a plan in place to help prevent future drowning accidents from happening to the children entrusted to their care. This bill received final passage before the session adjourned.

Building Georgia‚Äôs Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

The House also overwhelmingly passed Senate Bill 146 to provide a regulatory framework for elective vehicle (EV) charging stations and allow our state to regulate these charging stations to the same extent as gas pumps. SB 146 would provide that the sale of electricity at EV charging stations would be similar to the sale of gasoline, and this Senate measure would establish an excise tax set by the Georgia Department of Revenue to ensure that our state collects revenue similar to revenue that is typically collected from gasoline sales. The
bill would give the Georgia Department of Agriculture regulatory authority over EV charging stations, including inspecting these stations. All EV charging stations would be required to
charge vehicles on a per kilowatt-hour basis as a retail sale and include meters to record the total kilowatt-hours. These charging stations would also be required to provide accurate readings of
electricity to their customers. Furthermore, electric utilities could not provide, own, operate or maintain any publicly available charging station unless it is done through a separate legal entity.
As the EV market continues to grow in Georgia, its infrastructure must be able to efficiently and fairly support EV drivers, and SB 146 would lay the necessary groundwork for this developing industry. This bill received final passage this week and has been sent to Gov. Kemp for his consideration.

Reestablishing the Criminal Case Data Exchange Board

On Legislative Day 40, we passed legislation to help to dedicate state resources toward making sure that the state‚Äôs criminal case information is accurate, up-to-date and easily accessible to the appropriate parties. Senate Bill 272 would reestablish the state‚Äôs Criminal Case Data Exchange Board, which previously operated under the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council and later within an organization under the Council of Superior Court Clerks, to now
operate within a board under the Judicial Council and its Administrative Office of the Courts. The board would help review the state's criminal case data exchange and management systems;
make recommendations to improve data sharing with the public, employers and law enforcement; provide regular advice and counsel to the Judicial Council of Georgia; and update uniform standards. The Criminal Case Data Exchange Board would also report its progress and
findings to the General Assembly annually. By December 2024, the board would conduct a feasibility study with criminal justice experts to develop a system for tracking and analyzing criminal history data regarding recidivism, criminal plea agreements and immunity defenses, and this board would also study a system to track human trafficking charges and whether those charges resulted in convictions or pleas of lesser or related charges; the board would share these
results with the legislative, judicial and executive branches. The reestablishment of the Criminal Case Data Exchange Board would help improve the accuracy and accessibility of critical case information and provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the state's criminal justice system, helping to inform data-driven decisions related to criminal justice policy and practice. The Senate agreed to the House‚Äôs updated version of SB 272, which means this bill is also on its
way to the governor‚Äôs desk.

2023 Study Committees

Each session, the House establishes study committees that work throughout the summer and fall to examine specific policy issues and/or topics that are important to Georgians. Before the session ended, the House adopted several measures to create new study committees that will certainly keep us busy until the 2024 legislative session. On Monday, my colleagues and I adopted House Resolution 488 to reauthorize the House Rural Development Council (HRDC) for
the next two years. Created by the late Speaker David Ralston in 2017, the HRDC will continue to work with rural communities to find ways to encourage economic growth and job creation and develop effective legislative solutions targeted toward supporting these communities. We also approved Senate Resolution 175 to create two study committees this interim, including the Joint Study Committee on Dual Enrollment for Highly Skilled Talent at Younger Ages. This education-focused study committee will examine existing and potential dual enrollment opportunities to develop highly skilled talent at younger ages. SB 175 also establishes the Joint Study Committee on Service Delivery Strategy (SDS), and this group will explore how to assist
local governments as they create SDS plans for their communities. The House adopted House Resolution 603 to create the House Study Committee on Certificate of Need (CON) Modernization, which will address how our 40-year-old CON laws can be improved to meet
today‚Äôs health care needs. Finally, House Resolution 519 was also adopted to create the House Study Committee on Fishing Access to Freshwater Resources, and this group will examine recent issues that have hindered public access to our rivers and other waterways. In the coming weeks, Speaker Jon Burns (R-Newington) will appoint various House members on both sides of the aisle to serve on these legislative study committees. 

Final Passage of House Bills

My colleagues and I also gave final passage to a flurry of House bills on Legislative Day 40, and I would like to make you aware of just a few of these bills that are on their way to the governor‚Äôs desk. House Bill 88, or the Coleman-Baker Act, would require law enforcement
agencies to conduct a thorough review of an original cold case murder investigation dating back to 1970 upon written request to determine if a new investigation could produce new leads or identify a likely perpetrator. This bill also sets guidelines for how agencies should process requests for these reviews and how to handle any full reinvestigations. Additionally, the University of Georgia‚Äôs Carl Vinson Institute of Government would create a tracking system and
public website about these applications and investigations. HB 88 would also allow a coroner or medical examiner to issue a death certificate with a non-specific cause of death. House Bill 120
would update the list of individuals with a suspended, revoked or canceled license who are eligible to apply for a limited driving permit by including individuals convicted of driving under the influence of a controlled substance or marijuana and those in non-compliance with a child support order. House Bill 163 would establish a student loan repayment program for full-time medical examiners employed with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs Division of Forensic Sciences; these medical examiners would be eligible for up to $120,000 in student debt repayment, which would be repaid in annual installments over five years. House Bill 188, or Mariam‚Äôs Law, would implement several changes related to sexual offenses in Georgia. This bill
would change the name of the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board to the Sexual Offender Risk Review Board (SORRB), add definitions of certain sexual felonies and add punishments for such crimes; this bill would also create harsher penalties for individuals
previously convicted of sexual felonies who are convicted again, and electronic monitoring would be required as a condition of probation for such individuals. The bill would also improve how the state handles sexual offenders who move to Georgia and clarify SORRB‚Äôs risk
assessment evaluation process/timelines for sexually dangerous predators. House Bill 414 would create the Veterans Mental Health Services Program, a grant program that would fund behavioral
health services to service members, veterans or family members through non-profit community behavioral health programs; the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental
Disabilities would administer this competitive grant program. House Bill 538, or the Georgia Early Literacy Act, would require schools systems to teach high-quality literacy instructional materials approved by the State Board of Education in grades kindergarten through third grade based on the science of reading. The Georgia Department of Education would develop and provide training to these teachers, and teachers who are licensed or commissioned by the state to teach literacy instruction would be required to receive training by July 2025. Students across the state would also take a universal reading screener assessment to monitor their progress in foundational literacy skills multiple times a year. 

The ""Truck Weight Bill"" - The General Assembly also adopted a Conference Committee Report on House Bill 189 to provide a 10 percent weight variance for trucks when hauling agricultural or farm products within a 250 mile radius of the farm or point of origin outside of the 13 county metro Atlanta region. (Douglas and Paulding Counties are in this 13 county metro region-that means the trucks are going around our counties- not through them); this variance would increase the truck limit weight from 80,000 pounds to 88,000 pounds on Georgia roads. 

While a number of House bills did not receive final passage before we adjourned, the General Assembly will have a chance to take up these House bills again during the 2024 legislative session. I will provide a more comprehensive review of bills that received final passage in the coming weeks, as well as an
update about which of those bills are signed into law.

Signing Bills into Law

Although the 2023 legislative session has officially come to an end, I look forward to sharing more updates about different bills that made it across the finish line this session and are on their way to becoming official laws. Over the next 40 days, Gov. Kemp will sign or veto
measures that received final passage by the House and Senate this session. Any bill the governor signs will become law, and any legislation not signed or vetoed within this 40-day period will
also automatically become law. House bills that did not receive final passage this session have been sent back to their respective committees, and these bills will be eligible for consideration
again next year. 

I hope that you will contact me if you have any questions regarding potential new state laws or if you have any suggestions for future legislation.

!!!Attention chicken customers!!!

Small family farms in Georgia are under attack by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. In 2020 we went through a long process to obtain a 1000 bird pastured poultry exemption in the state of Georgia. We were visited by the GDA this week. We had been told that some laws or Guidelines were changing. We had no idea that those changes would end our ability to provide a better choice when it comes to poultry, chicken and Turkey. Yes you read that right. We can no longer produce and sell chicken and Turkey that was raised, processed and packaged on our farm. It‚Äôs not the growing process they care about. The new guidelines said very little about the birds themselves. It was all about the processing. An up front investment that we have roughly estimated to be between $25,000 and $30,000. This is only an exemption for 1000 birds!!!

On January 24, 2022, the Georgia Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Animal Health Division confirmed RHDV2 in unvaccinated, domestic rabbits housed indoors at a single Cobb County premises. More information: https://agr.georgia.gov/Data/Sites/1/media/ag_animalindustry/animal_health/files/Rabbit-Hemorrhagic-Disease-Virus-Updated-01-24-2022.pdf On January 13, 2022, RHDV-2 was confirmed in a wild cottontail rabbit in Chaffee County in central Colorado, per an updated listing on the Colorado Department of Agriculture website: https://ag.colorado.gov/animals/livestock-health/rabbit-hemorrhagic-disease-virus-rhdv2 As of now, there have been confirmed RHDV2 cases in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as in Canada and Mexico, affecting both wild and domestic rabbits. Officials report a death rate of about 90%, which is why House Rabbit Society encourages rabbit guardians to vaccinate their rabbits. Even indoor-only rabbits are at risk of RHDV2, since the virus can be transferred to them by people (on their shoes and clothes), other animals (including dogs and cats, especially if they go outside), and even insects. The most important thing you can do to protect your rabbit is to get them vaccinated, in areas the vaccine is available (the Medgene RHDV2 vaccine is available in 43 states and Washington, D.C.). The vaccine is safe and effective. So far, Medgene safety testing studies report only rare instances of swelling at the injection site which resolve within 48 hours. Other possible side effects are a temporary slight fever and/or lethargy for 1-2 days. House Rabbit Society continually updates rabbit.org/rhdv with the best information about RHDV2.

There are limited cost-effective options to control herbicide-resistant weeds affecting these commodities, but more dicamba-tolerant acreage of soybean and cotton crops are being planted each year. EPA used research and input from state regulators, grower groups, academic researchers, pesticide manufacturers and others to inform the decision to expand registrations, and this action balances environmental concerns while giving farmers more certainty as they plan their crops for the upcoming year.
 
In September, I joined several of my colleagues in sending a letter to Administrator Wheeler requesting this move to support our farmers, especially as they continue to recover from market disruptions from COVID-19. I am very glad to see this action from EPA, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have for our farmers and in setting responsible environmental policy that doesn‚Äôt stifle economic growth.

We&#39;re all feeling the sting of the higher prices right now at the grocery store. So where can you get the most for your money? Love alive. Liza Lucas went to four different chains with the same grocery list to find out who offered the best price for Marcia Smith. A run to get groceries is all about strategy. I really started to stop buying in bulk so much like I literally have to purchase stuff week by week, the past few years have been hard on family food budgets and while inflation has leveled off in the past 12 months, grocery prices remain high shoppers like John Horn continue to adjust to the higher cost. Well, I always look for deals. So yes, I look for things that were on sale. A little bit more things that were closer to the expiration dates. If we knew we were going to use them soon. Here at 11 live, we set out to determine which store offers the best prices to help you get the most for your money. We&#39;re going to store with the same shopping list looking for basics like bread, milk eggs, things like that. And where possible. We&#39;re gonna buy store brands. Let&#39;s go. I popped by four major chain stores, Walmart, Publix, Kroger and Ingles, which have the largest market share in Metro Atlanta. According to data from the chain store guide and at each stop I shop for the same eight items in the same amount. A 40 ounce jar of peanut butter, a pound of 8020 ground beef, a dozen white eggs. Ok. We gotta get that milk, basic white bread. Remember we&#39;re gonna grab store brand where possible a frozen cheese pizza, a box of mac and cheese. Ok. We&#39;ve got our bananas. Let&#39;s see how it adds up. We came back with all of our bags and checked our receipts overall. We did the best at Walmart spending just over $21 before tax. Next was Kroger where we spent $25.12 followed by Ingles with $27.84. The priciest bill was Publix where we spent just over $29 and approximately $8 difference. We did notice an advantage to shopping around. For example, we found a sale price on ground beef the day we shopped at Ingles while we scored the cheapest cheese pizza at Kroger. Those we spoke with also avoid sticking to just one store these days. They&#39;re watching sales and monitoring prices definitely like kind of shop around and find where I&#39;m going get things at the, at the best value. And it&#39;s kind of crazy. I never had to do that before, but you really have to watch what you&#39;re spending because it will get costly. Liza Lucas 11. A live news. Ok. So our experiment was simple. We shopped minus special coupons or special store app. So we later followed up with the stores for their recommended ways to save. That includes tapping into the store websites for recipes, digital coupons and special deals which can potentially increase your savings.

A heads up this morning if you usually take Marta to the airport next month, that will not be an option. Beginning on April 8th, the airport Marta station will close for more than a month. 11 alive. Jerry Carnes explains why and what this means for you. It&#39;s time for major renovations at the transit station where passengers are delivered to the world&#39;s busiest airport. It could add time to your next trip here. I take Marta because it&#39;s convenient. Um and it&#39;s cheap. Uh And so if they&#39;re gonna take away the convenience factor that leaves the cheapness, but like how much is my time worth Marta&#39;s airport station will close for six weeks. Beginning April 8th, crews are replacing floor tile and preparing to install a new canopy prep. Work is underway to a new elevator. Marta&#39;s Chief capital Officer says closing the station at nights and on weekends was an option. But that would last if we, if we looked at the complete duration of the project, it would last, you know, 1718 months longer. Marta will continue to take passengers to the college Park station, a shuttle will then deliver them to the airport. The agency says plan on an added 30 minutes for your trip. It&#39;s not a problem for Timothy White. I&#39;m retired so I got plenty of time so they can&#39;t rush me. Joanna Satterwhite appreciates the advanced warning. I&#39;m glad that you told me so that I&#39;m not blindsided. Next time I come to Atlanta, there&#39;s time to plan for the disruptions coming in. April that could add time to your next trip to the airport. This work is all in part of a renovation project in preparation for the 2026 World Cup.

will consider authorizing A1 and a
half million dollar grant to improve access
to quality food. This is through Invest Atlanta. The money would also
help in creating jobs and community development
in areas needing to access groceries
and pharmacies. That funding could help areas like Southeast Atlanta, where it&#39;s now temporarily
lost access
to a grocery store that people
waited years for. Publix is closed indefinitely ms after opening to address a lackf access to fresh food and grocer. Ariana Muniz joining
us live outside the Publix on Hank Aaron
Drive this morning. Ariana that area long been known as a food desert. This was supposed to help and now it&#39;s like one step forward, 2 steps back. That&#39;s right, Cheryl. The publics and the garage connected to the grocery store e closed until repairs can be don. In the meantime, people are left without a nearby grocery store. And people who live in this area as well as city officials, they are concerned about the vod this could recreate
in this community. So I was hoping to, like, pop in the grocery store on the way home. It was a failed trip to the groy store for Kenisha Cantrell. Cantrell was attempting
to make
a stop at the Publix on Hank Aaron Dri, but the store is now closed indefinitely after part of the parking lot collapsed on Saturd. So it&#39;s interesting that they ce the whole store when they have a huge parking lot for people to use. Firefighters say a crane ws driven up to the second floor of a parking garage when it fell, rupturing a water line and causing a diesel leak. One person was hurt. Cantrell says this collapse is t just inconvenient but could be detrimental to the community. Af I was, I was I didn&#39;t have a cad I had to take public transporta. I even looked at it one time. It would take me like 30 minutes to an hour just to get to a grocery store, a
fresh food source. This is also a concern for the , as a store just opened
a few months ago in the Summerhill neighborhood
to address the lack of accessible
fresh food options. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens sain a statement his administration s worried about the impact this wl have on the safety and
access to food. Pharmacy services in the communy and that there is no exact timee for a full resolution, but the companies involved are considering a partial reopening of the store and parking garage. Branch properties, who owns the shopping center whe the public supermarket is locat, say they believe an
unauthorized person unaffiliated with ownership droa crane on the top level
of the parking lot, ignoring weight limit warning s. They go on to say that
they&#39;re working with authorities and
that construction will begin as soon as possible. Now 11 Alive reached out to Publix to see if they can give us some insight on a timeline ad when this public store reopened. We reached out multiple times, but we&#39;re still waiting
to hear back. Back to you.

The musician and entrepreneur made sharing his love of warm tropical places his lifes work . Stephanie Elam looks back at his journey to Margaritaville and all of the places in between. Margarita. Jimmy Buffett&#39;s laid
back songs captured the feel of lazy days in paradi. Some call this signature sound Gulf and Western, a mix of couny and Caribbean music. I love the Caribbean through a sort
of a strange way. My grandfather is a sailing
ship captain, and he sang the calypso songs. So all this sort of amalgamatiof material came in and came back , and I learned to be a
performer
and that gave me the vehicle to do it. Buffett was born Christmas Day 6 on the Gulf Coast and Southern. Mississippi and raised in the port city of Mobile, AL, he began his career making
country music, but only really found
his musical voice after moving to Key West in the. Changes in attitude,
Nothing remains. By the same, His time
among the colorful characters there helped inspire his tropical style and eventualy led to his landmark 1977 album Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes and its famous hit song, Margaritaville. Now I think. It could be my fau, but Buffett&#39;s greatest musical success was on the concert stag, not the charts. He made hundreds of millions of dollars touring over the decade, supported by his legion of diehd fans known as Parrot Heads. The audience is just so
much fun for
me to look at. I mean, there&#39;s
entertaining to me, as I hope I am to them. His music may have been laid ba, but Buffett brought so much energy to his life. He piloted airplanes, wrote best selling books, raised funds for Democratic candidates and amassed a fortune estimated at $1 billion through his Margaritaville lifestyle br, which included restaurants, hotels, resorts and casinos. Like his music, it was all geard toward capturing the magic of te tropical places Buffett love be. From New Orleans to the Gulf Coast down into St. Barts and other places, I stilln find magic in most of those plas where people think there
isn&#39;t any left.

This is really a big
deal if you know anything about that area, 11 li. Brittany Kleinpeter has more on how this area has transformed or the years and how critical this grocery store is for the people who live in that community. It was really just like a an laf nothingness. Located in the heart of downtown, only blocks from the Georgia State Stadium, sits the community of Summerhil. When we first moved here, it wa. UKIP see that there was movement and that there was definite ene, but it was basically
like a neglected community. Longtime residents
like Nicole and her husband say they
have gone without for years. People were here. It was just that a lot
of the infrastructure and those things that make a ciy were not here. And that&#39;s why both leaders and residents recognize the opening of a public grocery store means more than just a supermarket coming to a neighborhood. Fresh food access is very import to the vitality of communities. When we moved here is definitely a food desert, and as we&#39;ve gone through the many layers of movet and development within Summerhi, we&#39;ve seen so much
growth and
this is just adding to the growth. Justo give you an idea of how much ths area has transformed over the y, this is what it looked
like on Georgia Ave. right around the corner
from where the grocery store now stands
10 years ago. Over the last few years, you can see the dramatic
transformation in the area from murals to new construction to what it looks l. Now today with multiple restaurants lining the block, look historically of what Summer Hill was and
to the community, especially to the African Amerin and the black community what it. Just to see Summer
Hill really coming back and return to his resurgene of who it is and what it was is just a beautiful thing. Many believe the grocery store, which will include a pharmacy aa Piedmont urgent care is a welcod into what was and the emergence of what Summer Hill will now be. Brittany Kleinpeter 11 Alive News Mayor Andre Dickens says. As his administration has plans to bring grocery stores to other area food deserts as well, he says up next is Campbellton .

Don White is live from Atlantic Loring Heights Apartments along Deering Rd. She has the very latest on this developing situation. Don. Jeff less than an hour ago, police told me what happened here at this apartment complex was a targeted shooting that started from a dispute. They believe the victim is between 25 and 30 years old, and right now the suspect is on the run. Let&#39;s take a look at some video that we shot earlier when we first got here. Atlanta police say someone shot the man at the Atlantic Loring Heights Apartments around 2:30 this afternoon. 11 live cameras were rolling when investigators put a brown rifle in a police vehicle. We&#39;ve seen about a dozen officers out collecting evidence and talking to neighbors. Nicholas Viola lives across the street and says this is a normally quiet neighborhood where everybody knows each other. I would say that we don&#39;t have a lot of crime here for the most part. Um, we&#39;ve had some. Interesting there&#39;s a 3 way intersection where there&#39;s a lot of action. Whether it&#39;s usually car accidents, but a shooting that&#39;s. Yeah, I don&#39;t know. I got a 2 year old daughter, which is kind of scary. Police say the suspect&#39;s vehicle is a silver Nissan Maxima. They also say that neither the victim nor the suspect lived here at this apartment complex. We are going to continue following this developing story and bring you the latest developments tonight at 11.

Karis Belger is live for us in Centennial Olympic Park. Karis. That&#39;s nice. Cloud cover creates a pretty perfect scenario for runners if you&#39;re going to run that kind of a distance. You know, one of the runners who just crossed the finish line told me that one thing he was glad about was the fact it was not raining while he was trying to make his way through the entire course. And just to give you an idea, they&#39;re about 9000 registered participants for this race this morning. Just look over my shoulder. You can kind of see where the finish line is. People are making their way across that finish line. They look a little tired, as they should be because they are not only passing through major Atlanta landmarks starting in Centennial Olympic Park and going through Piedmont Park and then taking away. To the HBC campuses, so Spelman and Morehouse before coming all the way back here, but they are having to do so to try and keep perfect time. A few people were telling me that they have their own personal records they&#39;re trying to break and we just heard that one of the elite runners possibly broke the record for the fastest half marathon run in the state. So that&#39;s really exciting. We&#39;re hoping to catch him as soon as he is finished on stage. They&#39;re giving out trophies right now, but a lot of people who are just excited to finish but also do so. A lot of rain pouring down because last year was pretty wet.

Traffic moving smoothly. Let&#39;s hope it stays that way. Crews right now working hard to make sure that does happen as we are expecting some ice. There is a best case and a worst case scenario for drivers over the next few days. Georgia dot preparing for the worst case just in case for those who will be out on the roads, sub freezing temperatures and hot fresh pizza delivered to your home. Alex figures that&#39;s the perfect combination, so he&#39;s hoping for a spike in business Friday. He&#39;s not worried about any patches of ice on the roads getting between him and his customers. I feel like if you know what you&#39;re doing, you can drive. Moments after I spoke with Alex more, Georgia dot trucks headed to the interstates and state highways to treat the surfaces with one coat after another of brine to prevent the services from freezing. Hoping the predicted rain is brief and that the winds evaporate the moisture from the roads. That would be the best case scenario. I asked 11 alive meteorologist Nicole Hartford. How far would you have to drive to get away from the threats of ice on the road this weekend? Friday morning you&#39;d have to drive to South Georgia to get away from. Freezing conditions, but by Saturday morning you&#39;d have to drive to South Florida to guarantee your roads are ice free. Patsy Jones of Atlanta has a full tank of gas and a new car battery and plenty of food at home. She&#39;s staying right here, certain she can handle the roads and any ice patches. You just gotta go slow and easy and you know. Don&#39;t get no hurry and don&#39;t slam on no brakes. And longtime drivers in North Georgia will remember that those county roads and city streets that people take to get to and from the state highways may not be treated at all for ice in Atlanta. John Sherick, 11, alive news. If you are nervous to drive in this Arctic blast, Marta has you covered. They&#39;re planning to operate as normal tomorrow. That&#39;s according to this tweet sent out today. Just make sure you check Marta&#39;s alerts page in case anything changes.

#SAFEkids #Fultoncounty #carseats #carseatsafety"," Hi, I'm Charlene Simmons with Fulton County Board of Health, Safe Kids Fulton Coordinator. Safe Kids Fulton is an injury prevention program where we focus on all things safe for children. Our focus groups are water, fire, bike safety, traffic, pedestrian, and child passenger safety seats. Today we're gonna mainly focus on installing and talking about car seat safety. When looking for a car seat, first look at your budget. Do not spend outside of your norm and what you can afford because somebody said that was the best. We always focus on good, better, and best. Good staying in the parameters of what the law states and that you should have a car seat and that's for every passenger in the car, as well as a seat belt, as well as what suits your nature for your child. When purchasing a car seat, you want to look at the height of the child, the tallness or the shortness, the weight of the child, whether it's an infant, a toddler, a three year old, a four year old, or an eight year old. All of that goes into the size and the weight because the manufacturer's determined what's best for the car seat by the size, the weight, and the height of the child. If it does not come with the car seat and it's not manufactured by the car seat, don't use it. I repeat, if it does not come with the car seat and it's not manufactured by the maker of the car seat, do not use it. Before I do it for a demonstration of how to properly install a car seat, we want to look at a couple of key points. When installing a car seat, you want to focus on the belt path, you have the front pull with facing belt path as well as the rear facing belt path. You want to take the seat belt through the closest to the back of the seat. So if this is front facing, you're gonna use the top belt path. If it's rear facing, you're gonna use the smaller belt path. You also want to focus on your harness, your belt clip, and the adjustments of your harness and belt clip. When installing a car seat, and today we're gonna use a convertible car seat because it can go rear facing as well as you can turn it around for a forward facing. You still want to use the correct belt path. So since we're installing this one as a rear facing car seat, we're using the belt path closest to the seat. And you want to make sure that it is as tight as you can get it. You're gonna place your weight into the car seat, pulling back on the seat belt up and security. So that once you finish, the car seat does not move any more than an inch. This one is installed perfectly. Also, you want to make sure that the back seat, the front of the back seat, isn't up against the car seat. You don't want anything that's resting on the car seat to secure it in. You want to make sure that the seat belt is the only thing that's securing the car seat into the car. Now, one of the good things about having a convertible as you see, we now have a forward facing. And again, you use the same belt path that are closest to the back of the seat. So we're gonna use the top belt path. Run the seat belt through, pull it, put in your weight into the seat belt and pulling up, making sure that it still doesn't move more than an inch. One key thing to a forward facing seat, you have to use what we call the tether. The tether stabilizes the top of the car seat so that if you're hit from the back or you run into the back someone, the top part of the car seat doesn't just flop all over the place. Things to remember about when purchasing a car seat for your child. Look at the tags, the labels on the car seat. Remember the height, weight, developmental level and make sure that it fits your car and not any car. Also, you want to make sure that you're getting, you'll know if you're putting it forward facing or rear facing. You wanna make sure that you're placing the seat belt through the correct belt path, rear facing, forward facing. And when you're having it forward facing that you're using your tether for stability. If you would like to learn more about child pasture safety seat installation, you can reach me Charlene Simmons, Fulton County Board of Health Safe Kids Coordinator at 404-612-4236. Also my email address Charlene.Simmons at Fulton County, g-a.gov. Come join us on August 9th or August 27th, right here at 5829, Campbellton Road, the public shopping class, where Safe Kids Fulton is partnering with City of South Fulton Fire Department.

Ron DeSantis regarding an alleged pay-to-play scheme with the grocery store chain Publix. Will the network be held accountable for its false narrative? In addition to this, the media continues to spread the lie that Georgia's new election law is ""Jim Crow 2.0,"" causing MLB to pull the All-Star Game from being held in Atlanta. CNN's Jim Acosta talks about ""post-Trump stress disorder,"" proving even more that the MSM is struggling to move on from Donald Trump. We found out the identity of the man who ran his car into the U.S. Capitol last week, killing one officer, but the identity doesn't match the media's narrative, so you won't be hearing too much about it. And lastly, NPR toys with the idea of wearing masks even after the pandemic ends to help prevent flu and cold transmissions.

As you prep for your Publix Atlanta Marathon, Half Marathon and 5K, remember to fuel for America's Marathon Weekend. Allie Schaich, Starla Garcia, Melissa Fairey and Cali Werner are four U.S. Olympic Team Trials - Marathon qualifiers who train together in Houston, Texas. They also make a mean and delicious gnocchi recipe together. Full recipe below with all ingredients available at Publix. Save some time on this big recipe by using Instacart. Gnocchi ingredients: 4 lbs potatoes 3 cups flour 2 eggs 2 tsp salt Gnocchi Steps: - Rinse and boil potatoes until they're soft and you can puncture them easily with a fork. Drain and peel when cool enough to touch. - Cut potatoes in half and pass through a ricer. Let sit until at room temperature. - Mix the eggs with the potatoes in one bowl. Mix the flour with the salt in another. Slowly incorporate the flour into the egg/potato mixer until it forms a dough. - Once the dough is formed into a ball in the mixing bowl, cover a clean surface with flour and pull off a lemon sized piece. - Incorporating the flour that's on your working surface, gently knead the dough ball and roll it into a ""snake"" that's about 3/4 inch in diameter. Then, cut the ""snake"" into roughly inch-long pieces - this is the gnocchi! - If desired, use a gnocchi board to add texture and depth to the pieces. - Add gnocchi to a large pot of boiling water. When the gnocchi rises to the top, take it out and saute in some olive oil until the outsides turn light brown. This adds texture. - Cover with homemade marinara sauce, pesto, Parmesan cheese, or a sauce of your choice and enjoy! Pasta sauce ingredients: 2 tbsp olive oil 1 medium onion, finely diced 3-5 cloves garlic 2 tsp dried basil 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar 2 tsp butter 28oz crushed tomatoes 1/4 cup water Pasta Sauce Steps: - Saute onions for about three minutes, stirring frequently. Add garlic and cook for an additional two minutes. Add basil, salt, and sugar, then butter. Stir to combine. - Add 1/2 can of the crushed tomatoes, stir and scrape the bits from the bottom of the pan. Add remaining tomatoes and water. -Simmer for 10 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally!",,no longer populated,,2020-02-25T16:00:00.000Z,post data removed,,488.0,18.0,5.0,0.0,,,
