Danny, our Manager of Energy Assistance, says, ""We value our customers and want to make sure they know all the options available to them in times of need. Our team is dedicated to providing the necessary resources.‚Äù

Adam, our Director of Operations, has been on the ACFB board for five years and is passionate about their mission.

Because of this, powerful women leaders have been stepping up and playing a vital role in building stronger, more resilient communities. Through their strength, vision, and dedication, they are not only ensuring that nutritious food reaches those who need it most but also creating lasting solutions to empower communities.

Their compassion, leadership, and unwavering commitment are helping shape a nation where food insecurity is no longer a barrier to opportunity. Join us in celebrating their hard work this #WomensHistoryMonth‚Äîand all year long!

Girl Scouts are encouraged to discover the needs in their own communities, which helps them understand that ‚Äúfood insecurity can be everywhere and there are a lot of ways they can be involved,‚Äù said Lindy Wood, senior education and outreach manager for Atlanta Community Food Bank.

I've been with the Atlanta Community Food Bank for five years. I recently got my start in the warehouse. Everything that's been going on these last few weeks has been devastating for a lot of people. Not just in the Augusta area, even in Arlington area about people who have gone without power and it's affected people from county to county. Since I've been here, I've seen people walk amongst with open arms. I've seen so much love. It's been a wonderful experience coming here to help the people that are in need, due to the hurricane. It's been amazing to meet different people here and their experiences, hearing how grateful they are. It's actually humble me and more ways than normal. I'm really excited to be here. Hope I get to come again. People coming and dropping off water food, perishable items for like storage and going to a self-career, a minor and going all throughout the Augusta area. I think that this is what we're doing. You know, I've been in IT for four or a few years and this is, I haven't really been able to have any but my boost on the ground.

The team at Masco Support Services in Georgia toured the Atlanta Community Food Bank to learn more about food insecurity and how their contribution will make a difference.

This donation helps increase access to fresh, healthy produce for families across Georgia. Each year, local farmers donate over 32 million pounds of nutritious, #2 grade produce that may not look perfect but is still perfectly nourishing. With hunger being a critical health issue‚Äîwhere 1 in 3 pantry visitors has a household member with diabetes‚Äîthis support is vital in getting fresh food to those who need it most.

Five days after a global cyber outage, it really caused a mess. Now the US Department of Transportation&#39;s Office of Aviation is stepping in and launching an investigation just hours ago. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on social media platform X that the investigation into Delta Airlines is to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions. He writes, quote, all airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly and I will make sure that right is upheld. 11 0 lives. Ariana Moniz joins us live now from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport, Ariana for days. We&#39;ve been seeing long lines, bandon luggage, piling up what are conditions like for passengers today? That&#39;s right, Chris here in Harville, we&#39;re still seeing some passengers who tell us that they&#39;ve been stranded for days at a time. And we&#39;re also seeing rows and rows of unclaimed luggage while other airlines seem to have been able to recover from Friday&#39;s cyber global outage is still appears that Delta they&#39;re still struggling to get back on track. Now I will say that the airport is not filled with as many travelers as we saw on Monday. But there are still passengers who tell us that they&#39;ve waited for days to get back home or to their destination. And that&#39;s of course due to the ongoing delays and cancellations that we still see here at heart. So now at last check, there have been 211 cancellations here at Hearts today and 203 of those flights are Delta Airlines. And that&#39;s according to and on Monday, a little under 2500 flights were canceled and under 1100 Delta flights. Now we spoke to a traveler who has been caught up in the ongoing travel disruptions. She says that she&#39;s just trying to get back home to Arizona but said she&#39;s found herself stuck here at the airport or sitting on planes going nowhere for hours. Take a listen. So I had a layover here in Atlanta and they boarded us on the plane and we sat there for three hours. Apparently, you are not allowed to sit on a plane longer than three hours. So we de boarded a couple hours later, they put us on a new plane where we sat for about 90 minutes and actually got to the tarmac, but then the pilot timed out. So we drove back to the gate, got off and about 4 a.m. they canceled our flight. So my luggage is still on that flight. So I&#39;m trying to find my way to my luggage in Reno. And that&#39;s also the story. Once passengers do arrive to their destination, some are left without their luggage and luggage is now really crowding the airport. We seeing back fill the upper level balcony and rows and rows of backs. They&#39;re lined up between Delta baggage claim carousel for passengers whose flights have been disrupted for days at a time. Yesterday, we were able to be on the upper level balcony but we have been unable to be in that area because it&#39;s now filled with bags. Now amid this ongoing investigation by the Department of Transportation, the agency secretary Pete Buttigieg, he&#39;s first encouraging passengers to try to resolve any issues that they&#39;re having first with the airline. But if they feel that Delta is not complying with the agen agency passenger protection requirements, he&#39;s encouraging passengers to then file a complaint with the Department of Transportation reporting live from Hart Jackson International Airport. I for the life back to so many people trying to reunite with luggage or families are on a thank you for more information about flight delays and cancellations. Text the word delays to the number 404885 7600.

And that&#39;s really great because it is a problem for so many families that are kind of stuck in that little in between area where they have just enough but not enough. And some people, you know, you go home, you have a full fridge, you&#39;re able to go to the grocery store, go to mcdonald&#39;s, do whatever, but you have to think about those in our community who do not have that.

#HungerWalk #CommunitySupport"," Sunday, March 10th, folks. It is the 40th annual Hunger Walk Run. Atlanta Food Bank annual event and it's going to be a nice one. Happy to report that to you. The sunshine is going to break back out for the latter half of the weekend. So we're looking good. We may start off with a few clouds in the morning, but other than that, we'll get that sunshine in the afternoon. 45 degrees start. The event itself starts at the Home Depot Backyard at noon. That's where registration will take place. The actual walk run takes place at two o'clock. Temperatures right at 52 degrees by noon. On our way to near 60 for an afternoon high. In fact, by the time the event ends by four o'clock will be at 58 degrees. If you're going to be hanging out talking about your time that you walk or ran 56 degrees will be our temperature by the time we hit six o'clock. It's going to be a great event. Have some fun out there folks. And don't over exert yourself a little bit.

Well, alliance tells us why volunteers on days like giving Tuesday really make a difference for the farms and the gardens. They support the volunteers and the donations received from giving Tuesday allow us to be able to provide resources to those farmers and growers. Those resources consist of composting. They consist of workshops. They consist of also providing grants for those particular gardens and their um capacity needs. So that allows them to go back out into the community and to provide local food access for them. Yeah, they do so much.

So the Thanksgiving dish which is put on by the Atlanta Community Food Bank is now 25 years old. Yeah, that&#39;s right. So it brings in members of Atlanta&#39;s local news community, like our very own crash Clark to volunteer and help feed families in need this holiday season. And this year, the Food bank showcased their brand new location in Marietta. Take a look. This place looks like a regular grocery store, but it&#39;s actually an amazing new concept from the Atlanta Community Food Bank. And it&#39;s allowing us to get more food out into the community in places where there&#39;s a lot of need and also to develop new ways to serve people so that we&#39;re having a bigger impact every week. About 600 families in need who qualify, come here and shop for groceries, just like everyone else with families receiving about ¬£100 of food per week. You&#39;re really Dorothy from Kansas. I am really Dorothy from Kansas. Dorothy who yes is originally from Kansas, but now living in Powder Springs can click her heels and receive enough groceries to feed her family every month. Now, Dorothy, I noticed you before when we were inside, you were doing some shimmying while you were doing some shopping. That&#39;s, that&#39;s because I&#39;ve been blessed because this is a blessing thing for me. I could come for, you know, every two weeks and get what I need to make my meals and stuff. I help Dorothy fill her car full of groceries and she&#39;s not alone in her praise for this new concept where those in need are treated like everyone else. And then I can get good food, good food. That&#39;s not inspired. I can meet friendly people and I get to come twice a month. This means everything to me. This year, the Atlanta Community Food Bank is celebrating one billion with a B meals given away in Metro Atlanta. They started out only giving away ¬£15,000 of food their first year, but now they give away half a million pounds of food every day. It&#39;s demonstrates how the community can really come together. Uh invest in a cause uh and work together to really help solve an issue for our community. All right. So you know, hosting family or friends for Thanksgiving, it can get expensive. So we&#39;re gonna give you a few ways that you can save some money as you plan for Turkey Day first. Create a budget and stick to it two scale back on your menu, maybe leave out some of those sides that aren&#39;t such a hit every year. Three if you want to go potluck style, have everyone chip in and bring a side or a dessert. And fourth buying in bulk that can be cheaper. And you can also shop around for the best deals and finally ditch that premade and pre cut food. Just buy the fruits and veggies yourself and then cut them up that can be cheaper.

#debraforgeorgia #georgia #politics #alpharetta #atlanta #roswellga #miltonga #teachers #education"," day in the life of a political candidate with five kids. My husband took over the main duties of getting our five kids off to school this morning because I was out the door early, heading down to Atlanta for a breakfast with a state senator. I've done a lot of these meetings over the past year, both to learn what it's like to be a legislator and run for office, get advice, and also get to new folks and eventually maybe get an endorsement and it worked out well that day. So then I did some thank you notes in my car that went to lunch with a potential donor. I did not film any of that, went home, did emails, went to an SGC meeting at my school, did the afternoon shuffle, took some of my kids to soccer practice, then I got home, started dinner, and thought about how too many Georgia students don't perform well in school because they're hungry. And we should provide free breakfast on lunch, don't you think?",no longer populated,,2023-10-04T22:25:35.000Z,post data removed,,141,0,6,5954,,

#despensadealimentos #inseguridadalimentaria #CFCMarietta #CobbCounty #11julio #HISPATLANTA #Atlanta", right here in the Faroaks community there's a really large Hispanic population. Many of them are facing higher rates of food insecurity and we need to get them access to more food. Not just food but the kinds of foods that are really important culturally to those families and we got to have the right kind of service here so we've got a Spanish speaking staff who are here to really be welcoming and inclusive for all the families we're trying to serve in Faroaks. We know it's a big need and we're excited to help provide a better resource for this community.,no longer populated,,2023-07-23T16:46:38.000Z,post data removed,,20,0,0,2020,,

As one of the 11 selected Fellows representing Sierra Leone, Rugiatu joins a cohort of 700 young leaders from across Africa to engage in leadership development activities at various prestigious U.S. educational institutions. Through her business, Slay Farms, Rugiatu is nurturing not just crops but also a community of women farmers. On her 10-acre farm, she shares her extensive knowledge of sustainable agricultural practices with other women, fostering a network of empowered individuals with a common goal. The farm serves as a hub for learning events, where women gather to exchange expertise and stay updated on the latest advancements in sustainable farming techniques. Moreover, Slay Farms acts as a link, connecting these farmers with wider markets for their produce, thus ensuring economic growth for the entire community. During her time as a Mandela Washington Fellow, Rugiatu Favour Kanu had the opportunity to visit the Metro Atlanta Urban Farm in the USA. There, she encountered Bobby Wilson, an enthusiastic urban farmer whose dedication to providing food for those in need has earned him recognition as one of CNN's top ten heroes in the family category. Rugiatu was inspired by the farm's emphasis on giving back to the community and the crucial role urban agriculture plays in sustainable food production. As part of her commitment to volunteerism and giving back, Rugiatu and her fellow Fellows joined forces at the Atlanta Community Food Bank. They passionately packed food and assembled health kits, driven by the desire to make a positive impact on the lives of those less fortunate. In this act of selflessness, the Fellows found unity despite their diverse backgrounds and experiences, resonating with the transformative power of community service. Rugiatu Favour Kanu's work exemplifies the spirit of the Mandela Washington Fellowship and the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), representing the United States' dedication to investing in the future of Africa. Through sustainable farming and empowering women, Rugiatu is leaving a lasting impact on her community, bridging gaps and fostering a brighter, more equitable future for Sierra Leone and beyond.

That&#39;s right. And city officials were not lettingy questions slip in at all 11 liv. Bobeth Yates was there.
So, beau Beth, how did this meeting
kick off? Well, that city work session went
off without
a hitch, the mayor only addressing the mr very briefly, but only to say te will be a time to discuss the i. But city officials were adamantt they will not be speaking
on the topic. Take a look at City of South Fu. Employees physically
blocked the media from interacting with
council members. Each person physically escortedt of the work session
to avoid answering questions about the incident tht landed Mayor Khalid Kamau
behind bars. I came here tonight just to see hw the meat would run after all the drama over the last weekend. S Fulton resident Kelvin
Bennett was among many wanting to see
if the city would address Mayor Kamalu being arred and charged with criminal
trespassing. And burglary. But the matter was only mentioned briefly by the m, who said this was not
the time to
speak on the issue. When you listen
to the reports, you know, you, you ask yourself, you know, OK, trespassing. I get it. You know, burglary, if you look at the house, looks like it&#39;s falling into a , you know, I mean, burglarized. What? And resident Malcolm Witcd also shared his concerns. I dont think the city was moving in the right direction before the whole incident happened. So I think the situation needs to be addressed. I think that. Someone needs to call into quesn why the person that
held a gun
to the city&#39;s mayor has not been arres. And while someone answers, others have a sharp stance on the issue. We&#39;ve gotten so much negative publicity since our birth, just a lot of news that has not shown us in the best light. And this for me was the straw that broke the camels back. So I honestly think that the mar needs to step down 11 alive dide digging and found the mayor is just one of several. People who have been arrested ad charged with burglary for enterg the property on the 600 block of Cascade Palmetto Highway Monday. We spoke to a realtor who currey is battling his own arrest in c, but he decided not to comment. It&#39;s an odd
situation,
you know. Khalid has been speaking out against the Police Department ad and possible corruption within e government and then this happen. Now, city officials will meet again next Tuesday. No word yet on if they&#39;ll discuss this matter, but Eleven Alive will be there, and we&#39;ll bring you any updates as it comes in.

is underway for many families across metro Atla, and that means summer
break is almost here. But families are struggling to make ends meet, and for them, summertime meals and those progs that help provide assistance are often a way to keep their children from going hungry. Yeah, locally, preparations are already in place for what&#39;s anticipated to be an
increase
in need for those meals. This summer, 11 alives Cares. Belger has the latest details. The Atlanta Community Food Bank has seen a 40% increase in need over the last 18 months. That number is expected to grow once school is out for the summer. Our partners
that provide food for us that needs to be so. Every day, seven days a week, our volunteers come in and help us sort that food, Kenny Hill, the chief
supply chain officer at the Atlanta Community
Food Bank, says. Food insecurity across the statf Georgia has steadily
increased,
and we&#39;re there to try to help stabilize a little bit and fill in the gap, really rely on our donors, our corporate partners
that donate food. Combine that with the recent ped of high gas prices
and the expiration of extended federal SNAP benefi, and he says more families
have turned to the food bank and its partne. For help, the warehouse
packed high today with orders for various
food pantries. Atlanta Community Food Bank CEOe Wade says it&#39;s expensive
to keep things going. We&#39;re spending close to $2,000,000 every month right now just to buy food. And that is up, you know, four times what we were doing prior to the pandemic. Feeding America estimates one in eight Georgia children
are facing hunger. Chris Miner with the Gwinnett
County&#39;s annual summer meals program
can help.
We still think we&#39;ll serve about
100. 1000 meals This year, Miner says the need for ml assistance skyrocketed during te pandemic, then dipped. But it&#39;s rising again. Food security is still a priority in Gwinnett County. Gwinnett County will have 21 sis for free meal distribution over the summer beginning May 31st. That will continue through

Their mission is to fight hunger by engaging, educating and empowering our community. They've worked with more than 700 nonprofit partners to distribute over 65 million meals across Metro Atlanta and North Georgia.

Every month they receive nearly 9 million pounds of donated food and grocery products, 22% of which is fresh produce. These donated goods come from individuals and the local food industries, including manufacturers, distributors, farmers and retailers. They then distribute the food to more than 700 nonprofit partner agencies who operate food assistance programs in 29 North Georgia counties.

I'm looking forward to seeing their growth with continuing to resolve issues with hunger in Atlanta and Fulton County.

Every dollar you donate goes a long way to feeding families in need.,"The Atlanta Community Food Bank is on a mission to end hunger in the Atlanta area through more than just food. Their goal is to get to the root of hunger and food insecurity by engaging, educating, and empowering our community. President and CEO Kyle Wade has more. When we talk about food insecurity, we&#39;re really talking about a family. A household not having all of the resources they need to meet all of their basic needs. Which means that from time to time, they&#39;re not going to know where their next meal is going to come from, and they&#39;re going to need help from resources like the food bank to meet those basic needs. The Atlantic Community Food Bank is one of the largest hunger relief organizations in the country. We&#39;re really a large food distributor, but our mission is to engage, educate and empower the community to fight hunger. And what&#39;s interesting about that mission is even though we&#39;re a large food. Contributor there&#39;s nothing in that mission statement that says anything about trucks or warehouses or forklifts or even food. It&#39;s all about how we are bringing the community together, giving the Community knowledge and information, tools and resources so that all of us can make a difference in building a better community and ensuring all of our neighbors have the food that they need. So when we talk about engaging and empowering the community. That plays itself out in a couple of different ways. So it starts with this incredible network of partners that we&#39;ve built over 40 plus years. These community based organizations that work with us to feed people in their local communities. We&#39;ve invested resources in addition to all the food that we distribute to help those organizations have more capacity to serve their local communities. We have an amazing resource with the food. Bank providing an unbelievable, almost seems like a never ending source of food we. Know that we have one of the best food banks in the country and that allows us to grow and to think strategically about how we can use a Co-op in a community to provide food security. And so finding the right locations and partners and even one of the people I met while filming this is a possible partner for us to think about having a coop that creates community and using food to bring people together. The Food Bank is a pretty substantial regional nonprofit organization we have. Close to 200 staff members here at the food Bank who are just we we like to say we have the greatest food bankers in the world right here in Atlanta, GA we&#39;ve got a tremendous group of people working in a variety of roles across our organization. When I first got with the food bank, I worked as as a as a person in the the warehouse picking orders and just seeing the importance on that level as far as like if this stuff that doesn&#39;t get out then people. Don&#39;t don&#39;t eat working long hours during during COVID at at the height of the pandemic. Just seeing how you know this stuff really does a does affect people and during that time people losing their jobs and not knowing where they were going to get food from and the land of Community Food Bank was that beacon of hope to ensure that that people got food. There&#39;s a lot of ways you can get involved in our work. It all starts with going to our website acfb.org. There you can quickly. Find out how you can volunteer. You can sign up for a volunteer shift. We&#39;ll engage close to 30,000 volunteers over the course of the year. We accept volunteers as young as age 8. You can also at our website. Find out how you can locate a food pantry near you. Certainly that means you can help people you know who might need help get that help, but it&#39;s also a way for you to connect with that local organization and maybe get involved in their work. You can make a financial donation to the Food bank at our website. It&#39;s really fast, and every dollar you donate helps us provide up to four. Deals to people in need, so go to our website, acfb.org and there are a lot of ways you can quickly get involved to make a difference. Any donation helps the Atlanta Community Food bank battle food insecurity in our area. It&#39;s so easy to donate.
