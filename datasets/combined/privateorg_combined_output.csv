The Community Food Center established in Marieta will operate as a food pantry, directly distributing food to local families. The new site is expected to help approximately 700 families weekly and will continue to scale up as needed. 

The new CFC is made possible in part by the generous support of the
following founding donors: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Publix Super Markets Charities,
Subramonian and Lakshmi Shankar, Kaiser Permanente of Georgia, The True Vine Experience Foundation, and Delta Air Lines.

ATLANTA – The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) is urging Georgians to be cautious about eating pre-cut cantaloupe if they cannot verify its source. At least five people in Georgia have become infected with Salmonella likely due to eating the contaminated cantaloupe. Across the country, 117 people have also been sickened, nearly half requiring hospitalization. The Salmonella cases reported in Georgia range in age from 1-81. The cases are from different areas of the state, not concentrated in any one place. One individual was hospitalized but has since been released. The recalled cantaloupe is sold in Georgia at Sprouts Farmers Market, Trader Joes, and Kroger stores. The cantaloupe is sold as pre-cut chunks or in fruit mixes. Whole cantaloupes that are also part of the recall may have a sticker that says “Malichita” or “Rudy”, with the number 4050 and “Product of Mexico/produit du Mexique. ” More information about the recall can be found on the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-Salmonella-cantaloupes-november-2023. Most people infected with Salmonella experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps and recover without treatment in 4-7 days. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is concerned about this outbreak because the illnesses associated with it are severe, including fevers higher than 102°F, not being able to keep down liquids, and diarrhea that lasts more than three days without improving. Individuals who may have eaten the recalled cantaloupe should contact their healthcare provider if they have severe Salmonella symptoms. Do not eat pre-cut cantaloupe or whole cantaloupe if you don’t know whether it is Malichita or Rudy brand. If you have any of the recalled cantaloupe, throw it away or return it to the store where you purchased it. Rinsing pre-cut cantaloupe does not remove all germs if it is already contaminated with Salmonella. Rinsing whole cantaloupes can reduce the number of germs but it does not remove all germs. Germs on the surface of cantaloupes can then get onto the knife and inside the fruit when you cut the cantaloupe. Wash items and surfaces that may have touched the cantaloupe using hot soapy water or a dishwasher. For more information about the Salmonella outbreak, log on to https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/sundsvall-11-23/index.html."," ","no longer populated","","2023-12-02T01:55:27.000Z","post data removed","","0.0","0.0","0.0","0","","","","-0.9758"

This is really a big
deal if you know anything about that area, 11 li. Brittany Kleinpeter has more on how this area has transformed or the years and how critical this grocery store is for the people who live in that community. It was really just like a an laf nothingness. Located in the heart of downtown, only blocks from the Georgia State Stadium, sits the community of Summerhil. When we first moved here, it wa. UKIP see that there was movement and that there was definite ene, but it was basically
like a neglected community. Longtime residents
like Nicole and her husband say they
have gone without for years. People were here. It was just that a lot
of the infrastructure and those things that make a ciy were not here. And that&#39;s why both leaders and residents recognize the opening of a public grocery store means more than just a supermarket coming to a neighborhood. Fresh food access is very import to the vitality of communities. When we moved here is definitely a food desert, and as we&#39;ve gone through the many layers of movet and development within Summerhi, we&#39;ve seen so much
growth and
this is just adding to the growth. Justo give you an idea of how much ths area has transformed over the y, this is what it looked
like on Georgia Ave. right around the corner
from where the grocery store now stands
10 years ago. Over the last few years, you can see the dramatic
transformation in the area from murals to new construction to what it looks l. Now today with multiple restaurants lining the block, look historically of what Summer Hill was and
to the community, especially to the African Amerin and the black community what it. Just to see Summer
Hill really coming back and return to his resurgene of who it is and what it was is just a beautiful thing. Many believe the grocery store, which will include a pharmacy aa Piedmont urgent care is a welcod into what was and the emergence of what Summer Hill will now be. Brittany Kleinpeter 11 Alive News Mayor Andre Dickens says. As his administration has plans to bring grocery stores to other area food deserts as well, he says up next is Campbellton . Martin Luther King Junior Drive and other Southside areas.
