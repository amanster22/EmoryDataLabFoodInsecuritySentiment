Poultry activities are allowed to resume statewide after a bird flu outbreak in northeast Georgia. üêì

The ban was put in place last month after confirmed bird flu detection at two sites in Elbert County.  The suspension of all live poultry exhibitions, shows and sales is now lifted.  The Georgia Department of Agriculture says the two affected areas remain under quarantine until further notice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to announce that both commercial poultry producers in the control area and poultry enthusiasts across our state can return to normal operations,‚Äù said Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler J Harper. ‚ÄúWhile this announcement is a great step in the right direction, HPAI remains a significant threat to our #1 industry, and the Georgia Department of Agriculture will continue working around the clock to protect our state‚Äôs flocks and to keep prices as low as possible for Georgia consumers.‚Äù

Shortly before midnight last night, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published its initial findings from a study it undertook last July when it asked eight large companies to turn over information about the data they collect about consumers, product sales, and how the surveillance the companies used affected consumer prices. The FTC focused on the middlemen hired by retailers. Those middlemen use algorithms to tweak and target prices to different markets.

The initial findings of the FTC using data from six of the eight companies show that those prices are not static. Middlemen can target prices to individuals using their location, browsing patterns, shopping history, and even the way they move a mouse over a webpage. They can also use that information to show higher-priced products first in web searches. The FTC found that the intermediaries‚Äîthe middlemen‚Äîworked with at least 250 retailers.

‚ÄúInitial staff findings show that retailers frequently use people‚Äôs personal information to set targeted, tailored prices for goods and services‚Äîfrom a person's location and demographics, down to their mouse movements on a webpage,‚Äù said FTC chair Lina Khan. ‚ÄúThe FTC should continue to investigate surveillance pricing practices because Americans deserve to know how their private data is being used to set the prices they pay and whether firms are charging different people different prices for the same good or service.‚Äù

The FTC has asked for public comment on consumers‚Äô experience with surveillance pricing.

FTC commissioner Andrew N. Ferguson, whom Trump has tapped to chair the commission in his incoming administration, dissented from the report. 

Matt Stoller of the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project, which is working ‚Äúto address today‚Äôs crisis of concentrated economic power,‚Äù wrote that ‚Äú[t]he antitrust enforcers (Lina Khan et al) went full Tony Montana on big business this week before Trump people took over.‚Äù 

Stoller made a list. The FTC sued John Deere ‚Äúfor generating $6 billion by prohibiting farmers from being able to repair their own equipment,‚Äù released a report showing that pharmacy benefit managers had ‚Äúinflated prices for specialty pharmaceuticals by more than $7 billion,‚Äù ‚Äúsued corporate landlord Greystar, which owns 800,000 apartments, for misleading renters on junk fees,‚Äù and ‚Äúforced health care private equity powerhouse Welsh Carson to stop monopolization of the anesthesia market.‚Äù 

It sued Pepsi for conspiring to give Walmart exclusive discounts that made prices higher at smaller stores, ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äã[l]eft a roadmap for parties who are worried about consolidation in AI by big tech by revealing a host of interlinked relationships among Google, Amazon and Microsoft and Anthropic and OpenAI,‚Äù said gig workers can‚Äôt be sued for antitrust violations when they try to organize, and forced game developer Cognosphere to pay a $20 million fine for marketing loot boxes to teens under 16 that hid the real costs and misled the teens.  

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ‚Äúsued Capital One for cheating consumers out of $2 billion by misleading consumers over savings accounts,‚Äù Stoller continued. It ‚Äúforced Cash App purveyor Block‚Ä¶to give $120 million in refunds for fostering fraud on its platform and then refusing to offer customer support to affected consumers,‚Äù ‚Äúsued Experian for refusing to give consumers a way to correct errors in credit reports,‚Äù ordered Equifax to pay $15 million to a victims‚Äô fund for ‚Äúfailing to properly investigate errors on credit reports,‚Äù and ordered ‚ÄúHonda Finance to pay $12.8 million for reporting inaccurate information that smeared the credit reports of Honda and Acura drivers.‚Äù

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice sued ‚Äúseven giant corporate landlords for rent-fixing, using the software and consulting firm RealPage,‚Äù Stoller went on. It ‚Äúsued $600 billion private equity titan KKR for systemically misleading the government on more than a dozen acquisitions.‚Äù

‚ÄúHonorary mention goes to [Secretary Pete Buttigieg] at the Department of Transportation for suing Southwest and fining Frontier for ‚Äòchronically delayed flights,‚Äô‚Äù Stoller concluded. He added more results to the list in his newsletter BIG.

Meanwhile, last night, while the leaders in the cryptocurrency industry were at a ball in honor of President-elect Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Trump launched his own cryptocurrency. By morning he appeared to have made more than $25 billion, at least on paper. According to Eric Lipton at the New York Times, ‚Äúethics experts assailed [the business] as a blatant effort to cash in on the office he is about to occupy again.‚Äù

Adav Noti, executive director of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, told Lipton: ‚ÄúIt is literally cashing in on the presidency‚Äîcreating a financial instrument so people can transfer money to the president‚Äôs family in connection with his office. It is beyond unprecedented.‚Äù Cryptocurrency leaders worried that just as their industry seems on the verge of becoming mainstream, Trump‚Äôs obvious cashing-in would hurt its reputation. Venture capitalist Nick Tomaino posted: ‚ÄúTrump owning 80 percent and timing launch hours before inauguration is predatory and many will likely get hurt by it.‚Äù

Yesterday the European Commission, which is the executive arm of the European Union, asked X, the social media company owned by Trump-adjacent billionaire Elon Musk, to hand over internal documents about the company‚Äôs algorithms that give far-right posts and politicians more visibility than other political groups. The European Union has been investigating X since December 2023 out of concerns about how it deals with the spread of disinformation and illegal content. The European Union‚Äôs Digital Services Act regulates online platforms to prevent illegal and harmful activities, as well as the spread of disinformation. 

Today in Washington, D.C., the National Mall was filled with thousands of people voicing their opposition to President-elect Trump and his policies. Online speculation has been rampant that Trump moved his inauguration indoors to avoid visual comparisons between today‚Äôs protesters and inaugural attendees. Brutally cold weather also descended on President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2009 inauguration, but a sea of attendees nonetheless filled the National Mall. 

Trump has always understood the importance of visuals and has worked hard to project an image of an invincible leader. Moving the inauguration indoors takes away that image, though, and people who have spent thousands of dollars to travel to the capital to see his inauguration are now unhappy to discover they will be limited to watching his motorcade drive by them. On social media, one user posted: ‚ÄúMAGA doesn‚Äôt realize the symbolism of [Trump] moving the inauguration inside: The billionaires, millionaires and oligarchs will be at his side, while his loyal followers are left outside in the cold. Welcome to the next 4+ years.‚Äù 

Trump is not as good at governing as he is at performance: his approach to crises is to blame Democrats for them. But he is about to take office with majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, putting responsibility for governance firmly into his hands. 

Right off the bat, he has at least two major problems at hand. 

Last night, Commissioner Tyler Harper of the Georgia Department of Agriculture suspended all ‚Äúpoultry exhibitions, shows, swaps, meets, and sales‚Äù until further notice after officials found Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or bird flu, in a commercial flock. As birds die from the disease or are culled to prevent its spread, the cost of eggs is rising‚Äîjust as Trump, who vowed to reduce grocery prices, takes office. 

There have been 67 confirmed cases of the bird flu in the U.S. among humans who have caught the disease from birds. Most cases in humans are mild, but public health officials are watching the virus with concern because bird flu variants are unpredictable. On Friday, outgoing Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra announced $590 million in funding to Moderna to help speed up production of a vaccine that covers the bird flu. Juliana Kim of NPR explained that this funding comes on top of $176 million that Health and Human Services awarded to Moderna last July.  

The second major problem is financial. On Friday, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen wrote to congressional leaders to warn them that the Treasury would hit the debt ceiling on January 21 and be forced to begin using extraordinary measures in order to pay outstanding obligations and prevent defaulting on the national debt. Those measures mean the Treasury will stop paying into certain federal retirement accounts as required by law, expecting to make up that difference later.

Yellen reminded congressional leaders: ‚ÄúThe debt limit does not authorize new spending, but it creates a risk that the federal government might not be able to finance its existing legal obligations that Congresses and Presidents of both parties have made in the past.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúI respectfully urge Congress to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.‚Äù

Both the avian flu and the limits of the debt ceiling must be managed, and managed quickly, and solutions will require expertise and political skill. 

Rather than offering their solutions to these problems, the Trump team leaked that it intended to begin mass deportations on Tuesday morning in Chicago, choosing that city because it has large numbers of immigrants and because Trump‚Äôs people have been fighting with Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat. Michelle Hackman, Joe Barrett, and Paul Kiernan of the Wall Street Journal, who broke the story, reported that Trump‚Äôs people had prepared to amplify their efforts with the help of right-wing media.

But once the news leaked of the plan and undermined the ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù the administration wanted, Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúborder czar‚Äù Tom Homan said the team was reconsidering it."," ","no longer populated","","2025-01-19T05:05:26.000Z","post data removed","","59548.0","25539.0","4121.0","0.0","","","","-0.9743"

Officials with the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) said that the species is a ""serious threat to the state's No. 1 industry (agricultural industry)."" The first spotting in Georgia was made in Fulton County on Oct. 22.

Governor Brian Kemp has suspended the gas tax as of yesterday.  This will save you about .30 cents per gallon of gas and about .33 cents per gallon of diesel.

Both Cook and Colquitt are eligible for FEMA Individual Assistance and Public Assistance.  As far as individual assistance, in most cases, your insurance will be primary coverage and the individual assistance can cover any gaps.  Find more info at https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual. It outlines eligibility and criteria.  There will likely be more information coming on this topic so please keep it on your radar screen.

While still determining Ag commodity damages locally and to the east of us, there are some things in the works from U.S. Department of Agriculture, Georgia Department of Agriculture, and other agencies.  Check with your local FSA offices for more information; most of it will be to the benefit of our growers and producers.  Appreciate the work of our Ag Commissioner Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and Georgia Forestry Commission, and others in spotlighting the amount of unprecedented damage to our state's top industry.  There will likely be more updates on this at the state level in the near future as well.

There are still a good many of our citizens without power.  In the past on military deployments, I have lived for several weeks without power or running water but that was in a combat zone.  From what I have seen and heard, the conditions for our neighbors east of us are very similar.  I know from speaking to them directly that our utility companies are at the edge of their capabilities and are doing all they can to get power back. Updates are available at Colquitt Electric Membership Corporation, Georgia Power, and your city utility departments.

Thank you to all the private, non-profit, public, and neighbor to neighbor assistance that is going on, seen and unseen. It has been an inspiration to us. #Helene"," ","no longer populated","","2024-10-04T16:17:32.000Z","post data removed","","53.0","19.0","7.0","0.0","","","","0.8589"

But on a much brighter note, Commissioner Tyler Harper is the definition of boots on the ground, ""What can we do?"". He visited the farm today to help assess damage and start advocating for farmers in our area. We can't thank him enough, in a time like this it means a lot to see him out doing everything he can.  And in the words of Governor Kemp, all we can do now is ""Keep Plowing"".

When does the Farmers Market open this year? We can‚Äôt wait! A. The Union County Farmers Market is scheduled to open June 1 this year. The hours will be 8am to 1pm on Saturdays and 9am to 1pm on Tuesdays. We are looking forward to another busy season this year with many return vendors and some new additions. For more information, you can visit their website at www.ucfarmersmarket.com or you can call them at 706-439-6043. Q. Can I bring my dog to the Farmers Market? A. If you would like to bring your dog, the Humane Society‚Äôs Mountain Shelter has volunteers there offering pet sitting for a donation to the shelter, however there are no pets allowed under the covered area of the Farmers Market, with the exception of legitimate service dogs. This is because of safety regulations pertaining to the sale of food. It is the same reason you cannot take your dog into the grocery store. Q. I grow tomatoes and peppers in my back yard. Can I rent a booth at the Farmers Market this year? A. Many of the current vendors return year after year. This means that very few booths come available each season. Locals looking to schedule a booth for a season can download a copy of the application from the Union County Government website or can call or drop by the Farmers Market. A few spaces are left available each season for walk-up vendors. Walk-up vendors can obtain a space on a first-come first served basis. Preference is given to agricultural products. Q. What can be sold at the Union County Farmers Market? A. All vendors must meet and abide by license requirements from the Georgia Department of Agriculture, the Union County Health Department as well as those required by the USDA. Vendors can sell food in its raw or natural state including fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs, honey, USDA-approved meat, candied eggs. Bedding plants and potted plants grown from seed, plugs, cuttings, bulbs, and bare root. Woody plants and bedding plants may be re-potted and sold if they have been in the seller‚Äôs possession for 45 days (no resale of pre-finished plants is allowed). Fresh cut flowers and cultivated mushrooms are permitted if grown by the vendor on their property. No foraged items are permitted. B. Value-Added Agricultural Products are those grown by a vendor and modified/enhanced by the same vendor such as cheese, cider, dog treats, fiber products, etc. Vendors selling these types of products must have any applicable licenses from the Georgia Department of Agriculture (ie Dairy or Feed Licenses) and meet all federal, state and local regulations. C. Pre-packaged foods prepared by any process other than washing such as breads, rolls, biscuits, cakes, pastries, jams, granola, etc., can be sold. These must be prepared from scratch meaning there shall be nothing sold using commercially prepared mixes, crusts/shells, or fillings. Vendors selling these products must package, label, and have a Cottage Food License in accordance with the Georgia Department of Agriculture and meet all federal, state and local regulations. A full list of product qualifications is available online at: ucfarmersmarket.com Q. Can non-food items be sold at the Union County Farmers Market? A. All crafts are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. They shall be a product of a home or cottage type industry and include handmade soap (not produced by a farmer), woodworking, pottery, quilted/knitted/crocheted products, jewelry, cutlery, candles etc. Members selling these items must have created them. The items must be handcrafted, original, and exhibit a high level of quality and design. Q. When is the Trash to Treasures open at the Farmers Market? A. Trash to Treasures is open every Friday from May 20 ‚Äì October 14. It is open to customers from 8am to 1:00pm. Vendors can begin to set up at 6:30am and must be packed up and exited the market by 2:00pm. Q. What items can be sold at the Trash to Treasures sales? A. Anything can be sold including crafts, new items for resale and gently used items. Generally, food items are not sold at the Trash to Treasures weekly event. There are a few things which cannot be sold. These items include home canned foods, produce, and other food items. Also, people selling plants must obtain a live plant license from the Georgia Department of Agriculture."," ","no longer populated","","2024-04-13T11:01:24.000Z","post data removed","","5.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","","","","0.9778"

So recently, peanut growers from Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi gathered
at the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort for the annual Southern Peanut Growers Conference. Needless to say, it was quite the gathering. Damon Jones was there and reports on the challenges
growers face at both the state and national levels as they gear up for the upcoming harvest
season. [Destin, Florida/ Damon Jones ‚Äì Reporting]
While Sandestin might be a spot for those looking for a little fun in the sun, it recently
played host to a conference highlighting one of Georgia&#39;s staple crops, the peanut. Here at the Southern Peanut Growers Conference,
producers got an opportunity to hear from experts, share ideas with fellow growers and
get a fresh perspective about the industry. [Joe Boddiford ‚Äì Chairman, GA Peanut Commission]
We&#39;re bringing in a wider array of speakers. We&#39;re trying to reach out into other areas
that sometimes we&#39;re not thinking about. We have our county production meetings. We have a state production meeting in Georgia
every year. And that gets you the basic knowledge on the
production and all of that. But sometimes we need to think outside the
box. And this is an opportunity to do it. [Damon]
That&#39;s exactly what longtime Congressman Austin Scott encouraged the growers to do, as he
discussed an overlooked aspect when it comes to negotiating the new Farm Bill in Washington. [Rep. Austin Scott ‚Äì (R) Georgia, 8th District]
Who owns the data on, on the crops that come off your farm? Uh, some of the tractor companies want to
own it. The seed companies want to own it. Uh, ultimately, I believe it should belong
to the farmer. Now, if the farmer decides that they want
to contract that data out, that&#39;s an asset of the farmer and they&#39;ve got the right to
do that. But, you know, we have to be having an honest
discussion about who owns the data on the production on our farm. And that I hope will uh, be referenced in
the farm bill. [Damon]
However, that isn&#39;t the only issue being talked about in the nation&#39;s capital, as farmers
are being put at more risk than ever due to a drop in spending on our nation&#39;s food security. [Austin]
We only spend about one quarter of one percent of our total federal spending on the risk
management practices for, for our farmers. And so, uh, as a country that&#39;s a, that&#39;s
a very small amount. It, it puts a tremendous amount of risk on
the backs of the family farm. Uh, if reference prices and other things don&#39;t
move to give those farm families uh, more of a backstop if commodity prices fall, uh,
we, we stand the risk of vast bankruptcies throughout rural America. And that&#39;s something that would be devastating
for our country and our food supply. [Damon Jones/ Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort]
With that smaller safety net and the ever-increasing price of production, opening up new and untapped
markets has become a priority for the University of Georgia and their peanut research team. [Nino Brown ‚Äì Peanut Breeder, UGA]
One of the ways we can do that is by increasing the oil content of the peanuts as a potential
oil market for peanut growers to uh, participate in. The overall goal is to develop a uh, a dedicated,
high oil peanut cultivar um, that will make a, a potential grower just as much money on
the oil market as they would make on those uh, same acres in the edible peanut market. [Damon]
With those acres potentially going towards the high oleic varieties, that could improve
the grower&#39;s bottom line on two different fronts. [Nino]
Um, we want to uh, try to improve uh, really two markets at the same time. So, improve the prices they&#39;re getting on
their edible peanuts and then hopefully uh, also get some additional revenue from their
oil uh, high oil peanuts. You know, profitability is always number one
and diversity is also a really important component of sustainability. Um, and so, we&#39;re trying to address both of
those things with our efforts. [Damon]
Reporting from the 2023 Southern Peanut Growers Conference in Destin, Florida, I&#39;m Damon Jones
for the Farm Monitor. [KENNY]
Considering it accounts for nearly fifteen billion dollars annually towards the state&#39;s
economy, the turfgrass industry here in Georgia is one of the biggest in the country as more
than one-point-eight million acres contributes to lawns, golf courses, and other landscapes. Our John Holcomb reports from Wilcox County
on one operation that&#39;s been cutting quality sod for more than twenty years. [Abbeville/John Holcomb-Reporting]
Here in South Georgia, this turfgrass operation is hard at work harvesting some fresh sod
that will most likely make its way to Atlanta and transform someone&#39;s yard. This of course is nothing new for them as
it&#39;s something they&#39;ve been doing for more than two decades since getting their start
in the industry. [Chris McIntyre/Vice President, McIntyre Turf]
Majority of what we grow goes to metro-Atlanta area. So, if Atlanta sneezes, I guess we catch a
cold. So, we keep up with what is happening in the
Atlanta market. A lot of great customers, but it&#39;s taken us
about twenty-three years to pare down and get the great group of customers that we have
right now. We got some regular customers and then others
that just call in, maybe homeowners or uh, you know contractors that are interested uh,
in our products in our Bermudas and our zoysias. [John]
Over the years, they&#39;ve worked hard to expand their customer base and to expand their operation
by adding new production acres, crew members, equipment, and new varieties of grass. [Burt Bynum/Owner, McIntyre Turf]
We&#39;ve grown from starting out with one small field of twenty-five acres, one pivot and
kind of added on each year. Tried to add a pivot and twenty-five, thirty
acres. We started with a small crew with a manual
sod harvester uh, now we have two automated sod harvesters, uh, much larger crew uh, trucking
has improved greatly, we&#39;ve got a nice fleet of trucks that haul our sod regularly. [Chris]
Well of course we&#39;ve grown our acreage and then uh, we&#39;ve gone through and uh and a lot
of customers that we&#39;ve added uh, trying to get a good fit you know, we have to work well
with our customers and they have to work well with us and we have to know what their business
is, uh and so we feel like we&#39;re, we feel like we&#39;ve been successful there and that
has taken a good twenty three years to do. [John]
However, a growing operation also means more opportunity for challenges, like with costs
of inputs such as fuel and fertilizer, but they say the main challenge is mother nature,
as this Spring was unusually cold and caused their grass to nearly stop growing. [Burt]
This past year, uh, we had a good growing season, um, as winter came in, everything
was good, started warming up early, our grass started growing and then it got cool in March
and April and even in May, um, really cooled off for us, so it almost kind of put a halt
to our growing uh, trying to grow our sod back to where we could harvest it. [John]
According to Chris, there&#39;s one more challenge, and that&#39;s their water, as they can&#39;t grow
grass without it , which is why they rely heavily on irrigation systems and say they
couldn&#39;t operate without them. [Chris]
The uh, things we can&#39;t control really are the water and uh, temperature. And both of those are important for growing
grasses. Particularly our warm season grasses and then
uh, if we didn&#39;t have these irrigation systems and a good water source, uh, we have ground
water and surface water uh, that we are able to draw from, but we couldn&#39;t do what we do
without this irrigation. Anytime we do add new acreage, it&#39;s a must. It&#39;s got to have a way to put water on it. [John]
Reporting in Abbeville for the Farm Monitor, I&#39;m John Holcomb. [KENNY]
After The break; from ensuring food safety, to investigating animal cruelty, labor trafficking,
and even agro-terrorism. Harlan Proveaux and his team are on a mission
to protect Georgia&#39;s Ag Industry. [Music] [Music]
[Lamar Black] Hi, I&#39;m Lamar Black from Jenkins County, and
I&#39;m a second-generation farmer. Been farming for sixty-two years and we primarily
grow cotton, corn, and peanuts. All of its gone grown conservation tillage
with heavy cover crop. Well, farming is, to me a way of life. It is, but it&#39;s a very good life, but it also
a business. You got to treat it as a business and not
just as a way of life, but to be out here every day, planting, watching things grow,
and then hopefully have a good harvest, that is a very good feeling. Well, first of all, grow about growing peanuts. I like to eat &#39;em &lt;laugh&gt;, particularly in
the boiling stage. But, uh, they, they&#39;re a crop that is challenging
to grow because of the many diseases that can get on them when all the weed control,
but they are a forgiving crop. I have had peanuts to, in, uh, trolley in
situations situation to, I would think they would never make anything because it had been
so dry and you couldn&#39;t get a good rain. I mean, a good rain, enough to wet the soil
well, two to three inches of rain and peanuts will rebound, make a yield. You just can&#39;t imagine. Well, the advice I would have for a farmer,
a young farmer that was starting out, was to realize upfront you going to have some
long hours, sometimes, not, fortunately, not every day, but, uh, you&#39;re gonna have some
long hours to put in. You, it&#39;s very expensive to farm. Even to buy land is very expensive now, and
to grow a crop, it become more expensive than it&#39;s ever been. But the reward is great when you can come
in, in late fall or early fall when you harvest a crop and then you find out that you&#39;ve got
a good crop and you&#39;ve got, and that, and that the, uh, you going to be in the black
on the, uh, profitable side of peanuts. Probably wondering why I&#39;ve been doing it
for sixty two years. But I, I, I enjoy it. I like what I do. I like to see.... I&#39;m out in mother nature every day, and I
like that. It&#39;s just rewarding to see, put a little small
seed in the ground and watch it grow to maturity and produce. Many times what you, the seed that you planted
was re-produced many times, and it is just all rewarding and you&#39;re so close to nature. [Music]
[RAY] In case you missed it, The Georgia Department
of Agriculture is now officially a Law Enforcement agency once again. Back in June, Commissioner Tyler Harper made
the announcement, appointing Harlan Proveaux as the new Inspector General, and Director
of the Law Enforcement &amp; Emergency Management Division. Commissioner Harper praising Proveaux&#39;s extensive
experience in both Law Enforcement and Emergency Management, while also expressing full support
and confidence in rebuilding this crucial division within the Department. Now recently, I had a chance to chat with
Director Proveaux about his new role, its significance for Georgia Agriculture, and
how it will directly impact our hardworking farmers and producers. [Music]
[Ray] I have to be honest; I don&#39;t think a lot of
people were familiar with the law enforcement division of the Georgia Department of Agriculture. It&#39;s really new to a lot of people. So let&#39;s start with your position. What are gonna be some of your main responsibilities? [Harlan Proveaux/GDA Inspector General/Director
of the Law Enforcement &amp; Emergency Management Division]
Sure. So I, you know, you, you, you gotta understand
that that agriculture is, is Georgia&#39;s number one industry. And, uh, I&#39;m responsible for assessing, uh,
the personnel and, and, uh, local and state federal agencies to ensure, uh, food safety,
investigate those cases, uh, involving animal cruelty and drugs and labor trafficking and
agro-terrorism, uh, and, and investigation of deceptive trade practices that people may
be, uh, committing against our farmers or agriculture industry in Georgia. [Ray]
And, and I think that&#39;s the big question too, Harlan, because a lot of people are like,
well, how is this going to be different from say, you know, Georgia DNR or some of those
other, you know, natural resource law enforcement divisions. So, this is really focusing on, you know,
the ag, ag sector, the hardcore ag sector of Georgia. [Director Proveaux]
Absolutely. You know, the, the, when we talk about labor
trafficking, you know, the, the, uh, migrant workers that come to Georgia, uh, that may
be trafficked. You know, we, we, we hear a lot about human
trafficking and labor trafficking is, is a, uh, is a part of human trafficking. And in agriculture, uh, industry is, is huge
with that, uh, with that labor trafficking. We wanna ensure that, that, that doesn&#39;t take
place in, in Georgia, [Ray]
Let&#39;s not forget, there&#39;s another factor that has really played into Georgia Ag, probably
the past, you know, eight, eight years or so. And that&#39;s natural disasters Harlan. Uhh, I don&#39;t know, you know, just, um, early
looking, you know, early glance, the things that you guys have on your plate, how involved
are you going to be in the emergency management plan for, for things like that? for hurricanes and stuff? [Director Proveaux]
Yeah, absolutely. And, and, you know, the, the, the emergency
management side of the house is, is within my division as well. And, uh, we&#39;re working already, uh, on day
one to enhance our response capabilities so we can respond more rapidly and effectively
to, uh, not only natural disasters, but, but, uh, uh, animal disease. You know, Georgia has a tremendous, uh, poultry
industry and, you know, the avian influenza is, is always a threat. Uh, so we&#39;re putting procedures in place now
to, to ensure that we have a rapid, a rapid and, uh, efficient response capability if
either one of those, uh, affects Georgia, uh, whether it be natural disaster or, uh,
an animal disease. And, and one of the things that we&#39;re doing
is, is, uh, developing and, and formalizing our response plans and making sure that they&#39;re
up to date and, uh, uh, that we have the capabilities to respond efficiently. [Ray]
Yeah. And last but not least, the, the, the biggest
advice, request, um, words of encouragement or wisdom you would have for Georgia farmers. Would it be, be patient, we will be there
for you, &lt;laugh&gt;, give us time to get this thing together. Would that be the biggest message that you
have to Georgia&#39;s farmers? [Director Proveaux]
Yeah, and I think one of our responsibilities, and, and we&#39;ve already talked about this in
house and, and Commissioner Harper&#39;s very, uh, very aggressive with making sure that,
uh, we keep our farmers not only, uh, in the loop, uh, with communications when, when,
uh, these, these types of events take place, but we wanna educate them. We want to educate them on our response plans. We want to educate, we want to involve them,
uh, and, and also let them know, uh, what our capabilities are and how we can assist
them, uh, during these times. Whether that be with, with, uh, uh, financial
plans through the federal government or getting reimbursements in these federally disaster,
uh, disasters, uh, whatever that may be, technical assistance, um, uh, response with, with, uh,
companion animal, uh, shelters, whatever the response may be. We wanna make sure, uh, that the farmers know
what our capabilities are and we keep them in the loop with communications during these
times. [Music]
[KENNY] Director Proveaux thanks so much. Up next; Are you a farmer struggling to manage
water usage on your crops? Look no further than the UGA Water Efficiency
team. [Music] [Music]

[KENNY] Well finally this week; with input prices
up across the board, it&#39;s vital that farmers maximize their efficiency in the field in
order to turn a profit. As Damon Jones reports, this is where the
UGA Water Efficiency Team comes into play. [Midville/Damon Jones ‚Äì Reporting]
No matter if it&#39;s corn, cotton or peanuts, the one thing each of these Georgia staples
need is sufficient water during growing season. And with rainfall being so unpredictable during
the summer, farmers must rely on irrigation to fill in the gaps. However, the amount can sometimes be tricky,
which is why having the UGA Water Efficiency Team to lean on can provide a little piece
of mind. [Jason Mallard ‚Äì Area Ag Water Agent, UGA]
So, we&#39;re trying to hit that sweet spot, putting in irrigation um, soil moisture sensors, helping
farmers with different types of irrigation and water management tools such as the smart
irrigation apps. We are working with them on um, some of the
different models and that kind of thing that we have. [Damon]
Getting that information comes from numerous tests done on a variety of different soils. [Jason]
There are some pivots in Southwest Georgia that we&#39;re working with where we have in the
neighborhood of um, fifteen, twenty different, individual plots under one pivot with multiple
sensors uh, we have two to three reps for each treatment under one pivot where we&#39;re
able to define that spot where we get the highest yield for the least amount of water
applied. [Damon]
It&#39;s not just research this team specializes in, but also the implementation, as they provide
expertise in the field as well as a pathway for growers to try out this new technology. [Jason]
There&#39;s new technology coming out every year that we are um, trying to help the farmers
and help them install and learn this new technology. Um, that part of what the Ag Water Team is
trying to do. We&#39;re going out and putting these practices
on the farm with the farmers at little to no cost for them to be able to try this new
technology and see how it works on their farm and get to um, experience that without much
investment. [Damon]
And this couldn&#39;t come at a better time as budgets are being tightened due to the ever-increasing
price of production. [Jason]
With input costs being as high as they are and um, even diesel prices being kike they
are, it&#39;s very important to have, to be able to apply water only when is needed. And that is also conserving pumping costs
and conserving our state water resources. So, yes, we can definitely have impact with
this throughout, throughout their farm if they apply this technology. And it does, it varies for um, the input costs,
yes, you pretty much get what you pay for when you use this technology. [Damon]
Even if some farmers aren&#39;t quite ready to implement this new technology, they are still
encouraged to have a plan for their water use heading into the planting season. [Jason]
From the lowest input, such as a checkbook method, all the way up to um, some of our
sensors, which re twenty-five hundred dollars per location within the field, just pick some
type of irrigation water management strategy and go with it. [Damon]
Reporting from Burke County, I&#39;m Damon Jones for the Farm Monitor. [KENNY]
WELL DAMON THANKS SO MUCH, AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS SHOW POSSIBLE. [RAY]
TAKE CARE EVERYBODY, WE&#39;LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME, RIGHT HERE ON THE FARM MONITOR. STAY SAFE, AND HAVE A GREAT WEEK

Greetings on state representative Mandisha A. Thomas of the 65th district of the Georgia House of Georgia House of the 65th district of the Georgia states of Georgia. We are in beautiful south fulton county today at your fair farms. We are having my inaugural event of the Cal Fed is designed to increase the literacy rate in the state of Georgia. Just a few moments you will be able to see the jam packed activities in the state of Georgia. Our mission is to help increase the Georgia literacy rate of second and third graders through agriculture vocabulary and farming. Hey y'all my name is Madison Dysar and I am an intern at the Georgia Department of Ag and Commissioner Tyler Harper's office. We are out here today at representing the Mandisha Thomas' Ag Literacy Camp in south fulton. We are so excited to be here and we hope that this is an educational experience for students to learn about the Georgia's top tank modenies and the agricultural industry that is our number one industry and we plan to keep it that way. Greetings and welcome to your fake farm. I'm Patrick Muhammad, the principal farmer and this is Lish Tardemahamit, known as the teacher farmer. And we're excited for you all to be in your fake farm for agri-litus. We are so happy that state representative Mandisha Thomas is considering your fake farm to launch this agri-litus for Georgia in 2023. We're excited to have the children and we're going to wow them today with literacy and agriculture. Stay tuned. Our goal is to offer AGR literacy classes for seven and eight-year-old students whose literacy rate is below average. To bring the students together to learn in an outdoor farm setting through agriculture. Hey guys, how are you? Good. Did you have fun at today's agri-litus.c camp? Yes. Did you learn? Yes. What did you learn? I learned that a tree can make many things out of it as wood. It can make food for it. It can make a piano and it can make wood in it.

The say sad on barrels of hay instead of chairs. They ate fresh fruit and fruit popsicles as they learned how to grow fresh basil and how long it takes for a chicken to grow. Students learned from five teachers across 12 hours during the two day camp, gleaming from each instructor's expertise. Hey guys, where are you going? To Chicago. To Hawaii. Chicago to Hawaii. What did you all think about the camp? There we go. What did you all think about today's camp? Agri-lituracy camp for kids. I'm very good. I'm ready to write. Do you think you learned anything? Do you think you learned anything? I learned it. You did put water in the soil and put sun. I learned it outside. And what did you learn, sir? Yes. I learned the red berries are sour and blue berries. Wow. So I'm going to let you guys go on the Chicago. You guys have a great time, okay? See ya! Children activities. Horticulture. The science of gardening. Dendrology. The studying of trees. Horseback riding. How everyday products like deodorants are tied to agriculture through beeswax. Picked raspberries and at yellow cucumbers. Planting and seeding. Learning how to raise livestock and even scooping poop. Plus much, much more. Hi, I'm Rocky. This is Ethan. I'm a family from one of our biggest local fields. It's that everybody, agriculture and literacy. I smell happy to be here and engage in educational science. I'm going to join agriculture as well as local farm and farm culture practices. And when it comes out, the support was feeling that it was a great advantage. And helping people with this art is super-like. You can find it. Agri Literacy is coming to a farm near you.","no longer populated","","2023-07-26T09:09:32.000Z","post data removed","","13.0","0.0","0.0","352.0","","","","0.4215"

But instead of celebrating, the child spent the day in bed mourning the loss of the family's two dogs the day before.

""They're extremely distraught,‚Äù Loftin said. ‚ÄúI mean, there was nothing to prepare them for the loss of these animals.‚Äù

Those dogs were among 11 that died in a house fire in Dalton, Georgia, late last week. All 11 of the dogs were being boarded at the Barks and Bubbles Grooming Salon. But how did they wind up at a home roughly 10 miles away? We spent Monday digging deeper for answers.

""They would read to these dogs and tell stories to them,"" Lofton said.

Nothing prepared Lofton and her sons for the sudden loss of their dogs while they were on vacation.

""My heart just fell to the pit of my stomach,"" she said. ""When we got back to the condo where my other family was at, I told them, and my oldest son just started screaming. And my youngest son just started running.""

Lofton dropped her dogs off at Barks and Bubbles, a pet groomer that also boards dogs. The dogs were staying inside a home when it caught fire. ""I was confused, and I'm angry that it happened,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI'm angry at the individuals that I left my dogs with.‚Äù

According to the Whitfield County Fire Department, the fire occurred Friday afternoon. When crews arrived, they found 11 dogs deceased.

""Had they been there, they would still be alive. So, I blame them for this happening,"" said Lofton.

Barks and Bubbles shared video of dogs playing outside on their Facebook page on July 1. The post has since been removed. The Georgia Department of Agriculture told us Barks and Bubbles was last inspected on June 15 and passed. But they told us the business' license expired on June 30. Licensees normally have a 10-day grace period to renew without penalty. As of now, we do not know if the business is renewing its license.

""It's not the way I wanted my son's birthday to turn out. And it is not the way I wanted the summer to go,"" Lofton said.

The Fire Department tells us there's still no word on the house fire's cause, and they say they did not have the equipment to rescue pets from the burning home."," ","no longer populated","","2023-07-11T23:45:08.000Z","post data removed","https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT3hjWkE0PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--877be55068b0b81974f36428bd762f5dab9967c6/post-1362701-137821449-thumbnail","137.0","0.0","3.0","0.0","","","","-0.9792"

The Georgia General Assembly returned to the State Capitol for the final two days of the 2023 legislative session on Monday, March 27. Then, on Wednesday, March 29, the session came to an end as the House and Senate completed Legislative Day 40, which is also known as ‚ÄúSine Die,‚Äù a Latin term meaning ‚Äúwithout assigning a day for further meeting.‚Äù  (My first Sine Die)

During these two eventful days, my colleagues and I worked late into the night to vote on legislation that will impact communities across our state. 

I will share some of the bills that we voted on from the
Rules calendars, as well as highlight a few House bills that received final passage this week.

Now, all of the bills that received final passage before we adjourned Sine Die will go to Governor Brian Kemp for his final consideration.

Fiscal Year 2024 Budget

Before we adjourned on Sine Die, the state legislature approved a Conference Committee Report for House Bill 19, or the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 2024) budget, fulfilling our one constitutional obligation of the session. Effective July 1, this final version of the FY 2024 budget
is set at a revenue estimate of $32.4 billion, which is $2.2 billion, or 7.4 percent, more than the Fiscal Year 2023 budget. More than 50 percent of this state budget is dedicated toward funding our state‚Äôs K-12 and higher education systems and includes $13.1 billion to fully fund the
Quality Basic Education program and an additional $50.2 million in lottery funds to bring the HOPE factor rate for scholarships and grants up to 100 percent of last year‚Äôs tuition costs. I am also excited to announce that certified teachers and school employees would experience a $2,000 increase to the state base salary schedule through this budget. Nearly a quarter of the FY 2024 budget would go toward health and human services, and within this crucial budget area, we
included $42.2 million for Medicaid reimbursement rate increases for providers. To ensure the House‚Äôs public safety priorities are reflected in this budget, this conference committee report includes $23.5 million for a total compensation increase of $4,000 for more than 3,900 law
enforcement officers across 12 state agencies; front-line state officers would receive an additional $2,000 salary adjustment in certain departments. Finally, almost 10 percent of the FY
2024 budget would go toward economic development and general government services, and seven percent of the budget would support transportation infrastructure improvements. This robust budget is full of bipartisan initiatives, and you can find more highlights from the FY 2024 budget here. HB 19 has now been sent to the governor for his consideration.

Improving Juvenile Court Proceedings/Foster Care System

During Legislative Day 39, we passed a Senate bill to help standardize the process for children who may be taken into the state‚Äôs custody. To help avoid placing children in foster care unnecessarily, Senate Bill 133 would clarify several of Georgia‚Äôs code sections to improve
juvenile court proceedings for children who are in need of services, also known as ‚ÄúCHINS,‚Äù or for child delinquency or dependency proceedings. Under this bill, prior to placing a child in the
custody of the Georgia Division of Family & Children Services (DFCS), the court would first consider what state services have been provided to the child or the parent/guardian or what services may be available to allow the child to remain in their home. A judge would also
consider what efforts have been made to secure the placement of a child other than in custody of DFCS or if a child protective services report was made. After a child is ordered into the custody
of DFCS, the bill would mandate that a preliminary protective hearing take place within 72 hours of the placement and require all parties to provide copies of medical, psychological and educational assessments and reports of the child or the child's parent/guardian to DFCS, which
would give the state more time to act quickly to find a place for a child in need of an alternate living situation. In recent years, the state has struggled to find housing and foster families for children with complex needs, which has resulted in these children staying in hotels and other
temporary spaces. If Gov. Kemp signs this bill into law, DFCS and our court systems could do a better job ensuring that children receive appropriate care, have placement options identified in a
timely manner and, hopefully, provide services that could avoid placing them into foster care altogether.

Water Safety Plans for Swimming Lessons

We also unanimously passed a measure that aims to prevent drowning accidents during swim lessons. Senate Bill 107, or Izzy‚Äôs Law, would require the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) to develop a model safety plan for private swim instructors to utilize by January 1,
2024. This safety plan would include minimum standards for student-to-instructor ratios, secondary supervision recommendations, parent or legal guardian attendance, as well as the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification. Private swim instructors would be required to use DPH's model aquatic safety plan or have their own water safety plan in place by April 1, 2024. Violations of SB 107 would be considered a misdemeanor charge with a minimum fine of $200
for the first and second violation, as well as a $1,000 maximum fine for third and subsequent violations. This legislation is named after Izzy Scott, a four year old boy who drowned on his second day of swimming lessons at a private pool in Georgia. Following the tragic death of this young boy, Izzy‚Äôs family found that our state laws lacked safety standards for these private swim instructors, which initially prevented prosecutors from bringing charges against the instructor.
We were honored to have Izzy‚Äôs family join us in the House gallery this week to watch the passage of this important legislation. If SB 107 is signed into law, Izzy‚Äôs Law would ensure that swim instructors have a plan in place to help prevent future drowning accidents from happening to the children entrusted to their care. This bill received final passage before the session adjourned.

Building Georgia‚Äôs Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

The House also overwhelmingly passed Senate Bill 146 to provide a regulatory framework for elective vehicle (EV) charging stations and allow our state to regulate these charging stations to the same extent as gas pumps. SB 146 would provide that the sale of electricity at EV charging stations would be similar to the sale of gasoline, and this Senate measure would establish an excise tax set by the Georgia Department of Revenue to ensure that our state collects revenue similar to revenue that is typically collected from gasoline sales. The
bill would give the Georgia Department of Agriculture regulatory authority over EV charging stations, including inspecting these stations. All EV charging stations would be required to
charge vehicles on a per kilowatt-hour basis as a retail sale and include meters to record the total kilowatt-hours. These charging stations would also be required to provide accurate readings of
electricity to their customers. Furthermore, electric utilities could not provide, own, operate or maintain any publicly available charging station unless it is done through a separate legal entity.
As the EV market continues to grow in Georgia, its infrastructure must be able to efficiently and fairly support EV drivers, and SB 146 would lay the necessary groundwork for this developing industry. This bill received final passage this week and has been sent to Gov. Kemp for his consideration.

Reestablishing the Criminal Case Data Exchange Board

On Legislative Day 40, we passed legislation to help to dedicate state resources toward making sure that the state‚Äôs criminal case information is accurate, up-to-date and easily accessible to the appropriate parties. Senate Bill 272 would reestablish the state‚Äôs Criminal Case Data Exchange Board, which previously operated under the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council and later within an organization under the Council of Superior Court Clerks, to now
operate within a board under the Judicial Council and its Administrative Office of the Courts. The board would help review the state's criminal case data exchange and management systems;
make recommendations to improve data sharing with the public, employers and law enforcement; provide regular advice and counsel to the Judicial Council of Georgia; and update uniform standards. The Criminal Case Data Exchange Board would also report its progress and
findings to the General Assembly annually. By December 2024, the board would conduct a feasibility study with criminal justice experts to develop a system for tracking and analyzing criminal history data regarding recidivism, criminal plea agreements and immunity defenses, and this board would also study a system to track human trafficking charges and whether those charges resulted in convictions or pleas of lesser or related charges; the board would share these
results with the legislative, judicial and executive branches. The reestablishment of the Criminal Case Data Exchange Board would help improve the accuracy and accessibility of critical case information and provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the state's criminal justice system, helping to inform data-driven decisions related to criminal justice policy and practice. The Senate agreed to the House‚Äôs updated version of SB 272, which means this bill is also on its
way to the governor‚Äôs desk.

2023 Study Committees

Each session, the House establishes study committees that work throughout the summer and fall to examine specific policy issues and/or topics that are important to Georgians. Before the session ended, the House adopted several measures to create new study committees that will certainly keep us busy until the 2024 legislative session. On Monday, my colleagues and I adopted House Resolution 488 to reauthorize the House Rural Development Council (HRDC) for
the next two years. Created by the late Speaker David Ralston in 2017, the HRDC will continue to work with rural communities to find ways to encourage economic growth and job creation and develop effective legislative solutions targeted toward supporting these communities. We also approved Senate Resolution 175 to create two study committees this interim, including the Joint Study Committee on Dual Enrollment for Highly Skilled Talent at Younger Ages. This education-focused study committee will examine existing and potential dual enrollment opportunities to develop highly skilled talent at younger ages. SB 175 also establishes the Joint Study Committee on Service Delivery Strategy (SDS), and this group will explore how to assist
local governments as they create SDS plans for their communities. The House adopted House Resolution 603 to create the House Study Committee on Certificate of Need (CON) Modernization, which will address how our 40-year-old CON laws can be improved to meet
today‚Äôs health care needs. Finally, House Resolution 519 was also adopted to create the House Study Committee on Fishing Access to Freshwater Resources, and this group will examine recent issues that have hindered public access to our rivers and other waterways. In the coming weeks, Speaker Jon Burns (R-Newington) will appoint various House members on both sides of the aisle to serve on these legislative study committees. 

Final Passage of House Bills

My colleagues and I also gave final passage to a flurry of House bills on Legislative Day 40, and I would like to make you aware of just a few of these bills that are on their way to the governor‚Äôs desk. House Bill 88, or the Coleman-Baker Act, would require law enforcement
agencies to conduct a thorough review of an original cold case murder investigation dating back to 1970 upon written request to determine if a new investigation could produce new leads or identify a likely perpetrator. This bill also sets guidelines for how agencies should process requests for these reviews and how to handle any full reinvestigations. Additionally, the University of Georgia‚Äôs Carl Vinson Institute of Government would create a tracking system and
public website about these applications and investigations. HB 88 would also allow a coroner or medical examiner to issue a death certificate with a non-specific cause of death. House Bill 120
would update the list of individuals with a suspended, revoked or canceled license who are eligible to apply for a limited driving permit by including individuals convicted of driving under the influence of a controlled substance or marijuana and those in non-compliance with a child support order. House Bill 163 would establish a student loan repayment program for full-time medical examiners employed with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs Division of Forensic Sciences; these medical examiners would be eligible for up to $120,000 in student debt repayment, which would be repaid in annual installments over five years. House Bill 188, or Mariam‚Äôs Law, would implement several changes related to sexual offenses in Georgia. This bill
would change the name of the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board to the Sexual Offender Risk Review Board (SORRB), add definitions of certain sexual felonies and add punishments for such crimes; this bill would also create harsher penalties for individuals
previously convicted of sexual felonies who are convicted again, and electronic monitoring would be required as a condition of probation for such individuals. The bill would also improve how the state handles sexual offenders who move to Georgia and clarify SORRB‚Äôs risk
assessment evaluation process/timelines for sexually dangerous predators. House Bill 414 would create the Veterans Mental Health Services Program, a grant program that would fund behavioral
health services to service members, veterans or family members through non-profit community behavioral health programs; the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental
Disabilities would administer this competitive grant program. House Bill 538, or the Georgia Early Literacy Act, would require schools systems to teach high-quality literacy instructional materials approved by the State Board of Education in grades kindergarten through third grade based on the science of reading. The Georgia Department of Education would develop and provide training to these teachers, and teachers who are licensed or commissioned by the state to teach literacy instruction would be required to receive training by July 2025. Students across the state would also take a universal reading screener assessment to monitor their progress in foundational literacy skills multiple times a year. 

The ""Truck Weight Bill"" - The General Assembly also adopted a Conference Committee Report on House Bill 189 to provide a 10 percent weight variance for trucks when hauling agricultural or farm products within a 250 mile radius of the farm or point of origin outside of the 13 county metro Atlanta region. (Douglas and Paulding Counties are in this 13 county metro region-that means the trucks are going around our counties- not through them); this variance would increase the truck limit weight from 80,000 pounds to 88,000 pounds on Georgia roads. 

While a number of House bills did not receive final passage before we adjourned, the General Assembly will have a chance to take up these House bills again during the 2024 legislative session. I will provide a more comprehensive review of bills that received final passage in the coming weeks, as well as an
update about which of those bills are signed into law.

Signing Bills into Law

Although the 2023 legislative session has officially come to an end, I look forward to sharing more updates about different bills that made it across the finish line this session and are on their way to becoming official laws. Over the next 40 days, Gov. Kemp will sign or veto
measures that received final passage by the House and Senate this session. Any bill the governor signs will become law, and any legislation not signed or vetoed within this 40-day period will
also automatically become law. House bills that did not receive final passage this session have been sent back to their respective committees, and these bills will be eligible for consideration
again next year. 

I hope that you will contact me if you have any questions regarding potential new state laws or if you have any suggestions for future legislation.

Let‚Äôs Keep in Touch
I am excited to spend the remainder of the year back home in House District 64 now that session is behind us. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime at my Capitol office at 404-656-0250, or by email at Kimberly.New@house.ga.gov. You can also contact me locally at
770-757-4223.

As always, thank you for allowing me to serve as your representative."," ","no longer populated","","2023-03-31T20:09:40.000Z","post data removed","","8.0","2.0","1.0","0.0","","","","0.999"

!!!Attention chicken customers!!!

Small family farms in Georgia are under attack by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. In 2020 we went through a long process to obtain a 1000 bird pastured poultry exemption in the state of Georgia. We were visited by the GDA this week. We had been told that some laws or Guidelines were changing. We had no idea that those changes would end our ability to provide a better choice when it comes to poultry, chicken and Turkey. Yes you read that right. We can no longer produce and sell chicken and Turkey that was raised, processed and packaged on our farm. It‚Äôs not the growing process they care about. The new guidelines said very little about the birds themselves. It was all about the processing. An up front investment that we have roughly estimated to be between $25,000 and $30,000. This is only an exemption for 1000 birds!!!

On January 24, 2022, the Georgia Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Animal Health Division confirmed RHDV2 in unvaccinated, domestic rabbits housed indoors at a single Cobb County premises. More information: https://agr.georgia.gov/Data/Sites/1/media/ag_animalindustry/animal_health/files/Rabbit-Hemorrhagic-Disease-Virus-Updated-01-24-2022.pdf On January 13, 2022, RHDV-2 was confirmed in a wild cottontail rabbit in Chaffee County in central Colorado, per an updated listing on the Colorado Department of Agriculture website: https://ag.colorado.gov/animals/livestock-health/rabbit-hemorrhagic-disease-virus-rhdv2 As of now, there have been confirmed RHDV2 cases in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as in Canada and Mexico, affecting both wild and domestic rabbits. Officials report a death rate of about 90%, which is why House Rabbit Society encourages rabbit guardians to vaccinate their rabbits. Even indoor-only rabbits are at risk of RHDV2, since the virus can be transferred to them by people (on their shoes and clothes), other animals (including dogs and cats, especially if they go outside), and even insects. The most important thing you can do to protect your rabbit is to get them vaccinated, in areas the vaccine is available (the Medgene RHDV2 vaccine is available in 43 states and Washington, D.C.). The vaccine is safe and effective. So far, Medgene safety testing studies report only rare instances of swelling at the injection site which resolve within 48 hours. Other possible side effects are a temporary slight fever and/or lethargy for 1-2 days. House Rabbit Society continually updates rabbit.org/rhdv with the best information about RHDV2. Be sure to bookmark our webpage to stay current on all RHDV2 news!","","no longer populated","","2022-01-26T20:36:50.000Z","post data removed","","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","0.9648"

There are limited cost-effective options to control herbicide-resistant weeds affecting these commodities, but more dicamba-tolerant acreage of soybean and cotton crops are being planted each year. EPA used research and input from state regulators, grower groups, academic researchers, pesticide manufacturers and others to inform the decision to expand registrations, and this action balances environmental concerns while giving farmers more certainty as they plan their crops for the upcoming year.
 
In September, I joined several of my colleagues in sending a letter to Administrator Wheeler requesting this move to support our farmers, especially as they continue to recover from market disruptions from COVID-19. I am very glad to see this action from EPA, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have for our farmers and in setting responsible environmental policy that doesn‚Äôt stifle economic growth.
