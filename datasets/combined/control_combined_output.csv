The inspection, conducted by local health authorities, revealed several violations that led to the lounge‚Äôs low score. Among the cited issues were uncovered food items, which pose a risk of contamination, an unclean ice machine, which could compromise beverage safety, and the presence of flies near the bar area, indicating potential pest control problems.

This development has raised concerns among frequent flyers and airport visitors who had looked forward to the luxury and exclusivity promised by the Centurion Lounge. American Express officials have not yet responded to requests for comment on the inspection results or on what steps will be taken to address these health and safety issues.

Local health officials have emphasized the importance of maintaining high hygiene standards in public spaces, especially in high-traffic areas like airports. They have indicated that follow-up inspections will be conducted to ensure compliance with health regulations.

Travelers are advised to stay informed on the status of the lounge before planning to visit. Meanwhile, the airport authority has assured the public that they are committed to upholding the health and safety standards across all facilities within Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport."," ","no longer populated","","2024-12-19T01:27:34.000Z","post data removed","","-1","0","541.0","0.0","","","","0.8834"

Vision 100, the airport‚Äôs strategic plan to reach that number ahead of its 50th anniversary in 2045, originally planned to hit the mark between 2030 and 2035.

The boost in travelers has made DIA the 6th busiest airport in the world behind Dallas-Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Tokyo International, Dubai International, and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International airports. 

However, it appears that the rapid growth has also resulted in fewer satisfied customers. A J.D. Power survey shows DIA ranked 12th out of 20 mega airports in 2024, falling five slots from 2023. That annual survey looks at six factors: terminal facilities; arrival/departure areas; baggage claim; security check; check-in/baggage check; and food, beverage and retail.

And to mark the date, the family of Tommy Evelyn and e Hawk are launching a scholarship fund to keep their memory alive. 11 alives. Brittany Kleinpeter just spoke with that family this afternoon. And Brit, what details are they sharing at what they&#39;re doing here? So in the last three hours they did rl they would be launching the Luke Hawk Scholarship this fall at. Abraham Baldwin Agricultural
College, where the 19 year old had planned to attend last year. They told me they just
want something good to come out of their
families tragedy. Luke was just sunshine. Luke was Luke was sunshine. This is Luke&#39;s aunt and uncle. He was always joking, always smiling. They say
the teen was
one of the most genuine people you&#39;d ever meet. He loved all things, living all things lemon. He loved all things lemon. And I made a lemon pound cake tt took forever to make
and he commented one time they liked to slice of. Luke was a man of few words and that was the highest praise he could bestow, the pair says. It&#39;s been a long year. For their family after their new Luke and his grandparents Tommy and Evelyn Hawke were murdered while working at the family&#39;s gn store on April 8th last year. Frequent customer at the store, Jacob Muse, was arrested days later and charged with murder. Police accused him of stealing e than three dozen guns while kilg the Hawks. We are praying for this person&#39;s. Salvation and their redemption. Despite suffering such a horrifc loss, the family&#39;s positive outlook is undeniable. It&#39;s just for us. How do we continue to celebrate their? Their memory and find some positive outcomes. A year later, the family has raised $40,000 for the Lucok Scholarship Fund, but they&#39;re hg to double that before the fall. Halfway to our goal
of 1 scholarship. Family has also raised funds for the Ronald McDonald House in Evelyn&#39;s name and local first responders in Tommy&#39;s name. Every day is a hard day, but we have really focused on. Keeping Tommy and Evelyn and Luke&#39;s memories alive. For those who would like to donate to that fund, you can find a link on our webs. The family also said
applications for that scholarship will
be available soon. The court case against
Muse is still ongoing. He is due back in court this coming summer in June. All right, Brittany, thank you so much.
