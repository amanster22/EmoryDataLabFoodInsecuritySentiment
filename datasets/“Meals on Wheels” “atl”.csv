Last week, we joined our fellow Meals on Wheels colleagues from around the country for the return of the much anticipated @mealsonwheelsamerica conference & expo! It was an action-packed week of collaborating, sharing (and seafood 🦞 🍤😋) that left us motivated to reach even higher in delivering the critical services that define our work. 

Thank you Meals on Wheels America for providing us the opportunity to recharge, reenergize and refocus! 🧡
