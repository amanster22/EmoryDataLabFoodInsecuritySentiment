Emory Healthcare's Community Breakfast series is hosted by Jen Schuck, CEO of Emory Decatur Hospital, Emory Hillandale Hospital and Emory Long-Term Acute Care. Our Nutrition Services Manager, Kristen Avera, spoke alongside other experts in the field of diabetes care and education to address some of the challenges and opportunities for individuals living with diabetes. 

The panel acknowledged the stigma and challenges around diabetes care but also spoke to solutions for these barriers and the opportunities to empower those living with diabetes. We look forward to seeing how more conversations with the community can help to further our mission of providing medically tailored meals and nutrition education to empower Georgians to prevent and manage diabetes.

#NutritionForAll #FoodIsMedicine #FoodIsLove"," Hi, I'm Matt Piper. I'm proud to serve as the Executive Director of Open Hand Atlanta. From our Midtown kitchen, our team cooks, packages up and delivers over 5,000 meals a day. Plus, we're doing nutrition counseling and nutrition education all throughout Metro Atlanta to help people understand the connection between really good food and positive good health outcomes. We can help people better manage chronic disease or prevent it in the first place. Through all of our nutrition services, it's a proud mission indeed. My name is Katie McKenzie and I serve as the Director of Development here at Open Hand. My day to day, I work on raising the philanthropic funds needed to make sure that we can make our mission a reality. And thanks to you, we're able to serve those around our community on a daily basis by producing 5,000 meals a day out of our Midtown kitchen. My role as the Senior Manager of Alter Services is to ensure that we have enough volunteers to help us take out the routes each day, as well as pack meals in our packing area. We couldn't do this work without people like you helping us each day on campus, as well as through your generous donations. So thank you so much for giving back. This time last year, I didn't, I was able to do a lot for myself, but since I've done some health issues, then delivering my meals has really come in handy. Having that interaction, like I said with the volunteers for a few minutes, once a week is fun, because they're very, very kind and sweet people. And it's just been a blessing. You know, to make the magic happen here at OpenHand, it takes a lot of support. And I am so deeply grateful to all of our donors and all of our volunteers who engage with us. Your generosity and your caring is what makes the magic happen. I truly am grateful for all the support that we receive. From the bottom of our hearts, OpenHand Atlanta thanks you, our generous donors and our wonderful volunteers, for making the work that we do on a daily basis possible. We are grateful, but know that more importantly, the clients that we serve, they thank you. Last year was an incredible year for OpenHand, and we actually served more people than in any previous year of our history. That's such a rewarding experience and feeling to know that we can be there for people who need our help. And we of course couldn't do that without our volunteers and our donors. I'm so deeply grateful to each and every one of them. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",no longer populated,,2021-12-31T12:01:25.000Z,post data removed,,12,0,1,0,,

Right now I'm here to introduce to you one of our famous faces who's going to be cooking for you this year. Now Chris Hall beside me right here. Now he is known for as the local chef here in Buckhead for local three. So I have here Louisa Bazarati and she's going to talk to Chris and ask him a little bit more about what we can expect this year. Chris it's delightful to be with you. Good to see you. I've known Chris a long long time since he was a wee Mr. Fist boy and now he's a grown-up Mr. Fist chef. And we're so lucky to have you of course is one of the stars of party in the kitchen and the stars of the Atlanta culinary scene. So tell me how you got started with party in the kitchen and Open Handed. So those many years ago. Yeah it was a few years ago now. For those of you that don't know there's an Open Hand Mafia, Louisa's part of this but Jerry Klaskella who I used to work for in Kevin Rathman called me and said you're doing this and it sort of just took life from there and then you then Helen Carlos called and the rest as they say is history and if I'm one of the faces of this whole thing we need to like figure out a better sort of thing. Absolutely not. From Wells hair that can represent Open Hand like my face now that's not going to be I wish I had Crumb Wells hair that would be awesome too but you are one of the faces but mostly you're one of the hearts behind party in the kitchen. One of the reasons I love Chris Hall is not only is he amazingly talented and we're going to talk about the food you're going to prepare for us but he has a huge heart and has been incredibly generous to open hand and just so many charities plus you can't say no to Helen Carlos right am I right about that. So what are we serving us at party in the kitchen? So I think we're going to do steam buns like kind of Bocham style so in Asian style steam bun we always try and vary it up every year and do something fun it's such a cool event and I love the fact that we see new people but we also see the same people and so we get to know people and they kind of know us and we can surprise them and give them something different because you don't want to you know go to the same thing two years in a row. It's always always always delicious at chef Chris Hall's table but also this year's extra special we didn't get together last year so how does that make you feel? Yeah it's so nice to be able to get out and see people and feel the energy in a room like we're going to have and just like that lifts you up and we're doing good and so many people during COVID this has been a struggle it's been a struggle for individuals and the people that the charity serves but it's also been a struggle for the charity right? Like all of us had to take a break it's different raising money it's different doing all the things that we do as a charity and so this year it's incredibly important not only to get together but to sort of reinvent and show a renewed vigor for this mission and what we're doing and have some joy right it's going to be great to have some joy together. Yeah that's a fun that's a fun room every year. We've got lots of energy to share with you this year this is partying the kitchen September 30th we look forward to seeing you there.

#inthistogether #nutritionforall #foodislove #GAGives #MonthofMeals"," For 33 years, Open Hand has been a lifeline for the most vulnerable in our community, and never more so than today. As it turns out, a global pandemic can either bring you to your knees or can challenge you to adapt quickly so you can respond to meet the increased need in the community. So we adapted, we forged ahead, and for the last five months, we never said no. We said yes to more people throughout Georgia and our entire need of our services. To more seniors who continue to shelter in place indefinitely, to more people with underlying better conditions, most susceptible to COVID-19. To more at-risk families devastated by the health and economic impacts of the pandemic. We said yes, we'll be here for you so you can stay home and you can stay healthy. We prepared and delivered more meals than ever. We began to shift meals for the first time to 39 more counties in rural Georgia. And we helped reach the gaps in our food security safety net with the help of our wonderful donors and community partners. But we still have so much more work to do, work that would not be possible if it were not for the tremendous support that you have provided to help us battle this crisis. We thank you, and we hope you'll continue to help us step up to meet the challenge. So many people rely on Open Hand for the food we provide every day, and we rely on you.
