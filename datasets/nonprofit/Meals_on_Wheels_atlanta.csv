I selected my dear friend and neighbor, Sally Ellms. You may recognize Sally from Ellms Family Farm! Sally is married to Chip and they have three children and seven lovely grandchildren. She was a teacher for 29+ years in Atlanta, Maine and Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake Central School District. Sally and Chip moved to Charlton and started Ellms Christmas Trees in 1984 and Ellms Family Farm in 2005. She is active in the Christmas Tree Farmers Association of New York and Ellms became a collection site farm for Trees for Troops (one of my favorite annual events!) almost 20 years ago. Sally is also active in her community, having served on Charlton's Comprehensive Planning Committee and the PTA. She currently is a member of the Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake Education Foundation, the Charlton Seniors and volunteer for Meals on Wheels and Charlton Founders’ Day. Thanks for everything, Sally!

With how neighbors are helping neighbors scare us, this is a crucial time. It really is. And quite a few nonprofits like Meals on Wheels have already been getting the people they serve ready, not just because of the holidays. But of course that anticipated cold weather. Earlier today we were in the pantry watching as people were unpacking some of those meals. Today, Meals on Wheels Atlanta has volunteers delivering one last set of pre made meals and pantry items for those seniors who can cook for themselves. There won&#39;t be any staff on site through later this week, so they&#39;re giving people enough for two weeks. The CEO, Charlene Crusoe Ingram, says right now her staff is feeding more seniors than ever. And in fact, we did set a record this year of 650 seniors, the first time we&#39;ve ever served this many, which means. It just costs more money to feed the seniors and we never want to say no to them. And I also spoke with must ministries. They provide everything from food to housing. They are already getting their warming centers and shelters ready for people who may need them. I&#39;ll have more information on that work as well as the work Meals on Wheels Atlanta is doing later on at 5. We&#39;ll see you then. Carries. Thank you. So if you or someone you know needs a warm place to go, here is a look at just some of the counties opening warming centers tonight, including the city of Atlanta. Officials want to remind you all are welcome. We do have a full list of warming centers and their hours. In line at 11 alive.com.

I love that it's in the middle of the room. I love that it's something people can interact with, move through, move around, and hopefully it inspires people to do a little giving. This piece was commissioned by SCAD specifically for Meals on Wheels. The basic design that I have is the body with the square head on top and then I've pushed myself to kind of break the square. The greatest gift of all of this is just connecting with people and learning from each other. I actually, my daughter to pose for a Portland for this particular one. And it's a piece of hope and inspiration for what is possible, what can we achieve to become a better society. The North Star element is there to kind of point to our children, our youth being the hope for our future. The title of the exo-exo at Atlanta is kind of stymmed from thinking about love letters in different ways that you could sign off a love letter. You could sign it off with a heart, you could sign it off with love or exo-exo and just the different connotations. SCAD has been a incredibly supportive for my art career. Atlanta has an amazing art scene. I love working with other people and seeing how they interpret the block head shape and how we can come together and create something new.

It’s robbed me and my family of a year’s worth of visits with my Grandmaw in the memory care unit of her nursing home. Unfortunately this week, so close to receiving the first vaccine, she tested positive. While her symptoms stayed mild, her heart just could not take the extra stress. At 91, Peggy Sue Brown Helton, a native of Douglasville passed away peacefully. 

We are sad, but there’s comfort knowing that it was quick in the end and she did not suffer. The last few years have been difficult, as she battled dementia and slowly slipped away from us. She’s now reunited with my Paw Paw, her husband of 65 years. While we weren’t able to say the goodbyes we would have liked…we will cherish the visits we had, when we could hug all over her. 

I remember as a little girl spending the night with her and asking her to tell me stories as we laid in bed. At an early age, she taught me the importance of giving back. She volunteered for years with Meals on Wheels, and I always loved being able to come along for delivieres. I remember us taking loaves of bread to feed the ducks at Hunter Park. I spent a lot of time traveling down I-20, between Atlanta and Augusta, before I moved back home to work for FOX5. We would talk for hours on the phone about life, while I drove down the interstate. More recently when I would visit at her nursing home, she would tell everyone, “This is my granddaughter. She’s on the television.” ☺️ I loved watching her with Ava and Cole. She always lit up when we could visit. 

I’ve shared a lot of our visits and stories with you on here, and I wanted to share this news as well. Grandparents are such a treasure.

And we're in the kitchen right now and this is the culinary team that we have. They've been working really hard the last couple of weeks more so than usual because we have a lot of hungry seniors. Usually what happens here we start about five in the morning and throughout the day after cooking we chill everything down and we start putting it into small individual meal packs for our seniors throughout the city. That gets done around two o'clock in the afternoon and then we start cleaning up. So it's a big full day of what's going on. Usually every day we do about 2,000 meals here and then we deliver them on Sundays or Saturdays depending on what day the client has a range for us to look to deliver them. We're focused on making sure the seniors are taken care of in the city and are committed to it.
