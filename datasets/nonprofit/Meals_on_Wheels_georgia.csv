Home NewsNewsUSAMilitary Arrests White House Deputy Chief of StaffBy Michael Baxter -June 1, 20224954402
U.S. Army Rangers on Wednesday arrested former Biden campaign manager and current Deputy Chief of Staff Jennifer Brigid O‚ÄôMalley Dillon at a Washington, D.C. hotel, the result of a military investigation into whether she took part in a ballot harvesting ring in which Democrat-liberal sympathizers, known as ‚Äúmules,‚Äù illegally collected and deposited ballots into drop boxes in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin during the 2020 presidential election.
According to a JAG source, White Hats took interest in Dillon after viewing conservative author Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza‚Äôs video 2000 Mules, which shows surveillance video of seedy individuals making repeated trips to drop boxes in the aforementioned states; in each instance the mules carried reams of ballots.
The video, our source said, sounded alarm bells in the White Hat community, and prompted a thorough probe.
Although Dillon goes unmentioned in D‚ÄôSouza‚Äôs video, the military began its investigation at the crest of Biden‚Äôs election hierarchy, believing that she, who became Biden‚Äôs campaign manager in April 2020, had knowledge of the scheme‚Äîor orchestrated it. Our source would not at this time cite specific evidence, but said JAG had obtained from U.S. Army Cyber Command ‚Äúconcrete proof‚Äù linking her to ‚Äúinnumerable‚Äù illegal ballots.
‚ÄúThe case against Dillon is open and shut,‚Äù he said.
The charge on a military arrest warrant was suspicion of treason, which, if proven, can carry a death sentence.
However, it‚Äôs still unclear whether JAG will prosecute Dillon or strike a deal in hopes she will lead them to bigger fish.

14ReplyYuanChenYuanChen21 hours agoThe 2000 mules group had 4 million minutes video tapes that monitored those ballot boxes 24/7 from October to November of 2020 from most of the swing states, except GA refused to provide the video tapes. The video and geo tracking would be able to confirm all the mules who delivered illegal and fake ballots and stuffed them into the ballot boxes, and have these mules be arrested. I watched the 2000 mules on May 4, and I am sure that these mules are identifiable based on the geo tracking data that can be traced to their cell phones. I also read a comment from D‚ÄôSouza‚Äôs YouTube site posted by a democrat viewer that be a mule to stuff the illegal /fake ballots into the ballot boxes is perfect legal, as long as they can defeat Trump. They didn‚Äôt care about the voting process, all they cared was the result, and that result is to take down Trump. I guess that the person post this type of comment could be a mule as well. Since this type of crime is technically traceable, and our military should make a massive arrest on these mules. Democrats only need to hire 20,000 or 3
