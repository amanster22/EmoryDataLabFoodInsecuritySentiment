___

It was a perfect encapsulation of the chaos that Trump has wrought. As he announced yesterday that he was going to proceed with 25 percent tariffs against Canada and Mexico and hike another 10 percent on China, a widget on the Fox Network showed the Dow Jones crashing in response.

[see comments for link to video]

By the end of the day, the Dow had erased over 600 points as investors braced for economic impact. Then last night, Trump rolled the dice, allowing the new tariffs to go into place, citing a failure by our trading partners to control the flow of fentanyl.

That was a red herring, of course. Trump wants something to point to in order to demonize our biggest trading partners. Now American consumers will suffer. And U.S. exporters also are about to see tens of billions in retaliatory tariffs. The pain will likely only grow from there.

**The impact on consumers

Unless Trump reverses himself, expect prices to rise on pretty much everything. China, Canada and Mexico provide most of the manufactured goods, raw materials and agricultural products imported by U.S. companies. Cars, cell phones, computers, tequila, fresh vegetables and fruit, gasoline—nearly everything we buy will see an impact, on top of the already high price of eggs.

Across-the-board tariffs means importers will either need to absorb those extra costs or pass them along to consumers in the form of higher prices. And as the cost of imported products rise, it will be tempting for U.S. companies to raise domestic prices as well in order to take advantage of the surge in inflation and pad their profits.

At least, that’s how most economic experts see it. Not so the White House. In February, Trump acknowledged that his new tariffs could cause “some pain” but insisted our trading partners, and not U.S. consumers, would bear the brunt of it. Similarly, Trump’s top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, who recently went to prison for refusing to testify before Congress about January 6, claimed on Monday that inflation from tariffs would be “second-order small.”

The U.S. imports over $900 billion annually from Canada and Mexico, so it’s hard to see how a 25 percent hike would only produce small amounts of inflation. Indeed, most economists and studies show that the effect will be noticeable and widespread.

“Because of the combination of these three countries, it’s going to be difficult to go down an aisle of a grocery store and not see some sort of inflationary effect,” Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told the New York Times.

**The impact on exporters and manufacturers

There’s a flip side to U.S. tariffs: our partners’ retaliatory ones.

China, Canada and Mexico have all been preparing for the possibility that Trump would do just this, though they tried hard to dissuade him from this course, including expending considerable energy, with notable success, in reducing fentanyl flows across the border.

For Canada, this is particularly frustrating because it doesn’t really have a fentanyl border smuggling problem to begin with. As the Times reported,

Just 19 kilograms of fentanyl were intercepted last year at the Canada-U.S. border, compared with almost 9,600 kilograms at the border with Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. And an investigation by The Globe and Mail, a newspaper in Toronto, found that the Canadian figure was inflated by the inclusion of seizures that were not related to the border.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement,

“Today, after a 30-day pause, the United States administration has decided to proceed with imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports and 10 per cent tariffs on Canadian energy. Let me be unequivocally clear – there is no justification for these actions.”

He went on to lay out what Canada planned in response.

Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow, respond with 25 per cent tariffs against $155 billion of American goods – starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately, and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days’ time. Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures.

Other Canadian politicians are reacting with outrage to Trump’s imposition of tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned, “If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything — including cut off their energy with a smile on my face.” He continued, “They rely on our energy, they need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard, we’re going to come back twice as hard.”

Premier Ford added that Michigan auto plants would likely shut down within a week and that he would halt nickel shipments and cross-border transmission of electricity from Ontario to the U.S. “I’m going after absolutely everything,” Ford said.

In contrast to Canada, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum had taken a cautious approach, continuing to make a strong case against tariffs and even endeavoring to prove her country is doing everything possible to allay Trump’s asserted concerns. As the Associated Press reported, last week Mexico turned over 29 drug cartel figures to the U.S. and dismantled over 100 drug labs of the Sinaloa Cartel. But these efforts were brushed aside by Trump as insufficient, signaling that he had never been very serious about tying fentanyl to tariffs.

In response to Trump’s renewed tariff threat, President Sheinbaum cautioned, “It’s very important that the people know that we have made a very important effort of coordination, of collaboration, but it depends on the United States,” Sheinbaum said. “We have to respond to this decision.” An announcement of retaliatory measures by Mexico is expected later this week.

China responded to Trump’s hike in tariffs with a measured response, announcing a 15 percent new tariff on U.S. chicken, wheat, corn and cotton products and a 10 percent tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish products. “The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.

The last time China responded to Trump’s tariffs, farmers across the Midwest were hit badly enough that they needed a $28 billion bailout from the federal government. Trump appears to understand that there will be pain in the form of Chinese retaliation. He tweeted that U.S. farmers need to “start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States” and further warned that there will be more tariffs on external farm products coming in a month.

[See comments for post from Trump]

He ended with, ”Have fun!” Because he just doesn’t care.

**Tariffs are the new unwelcome disaster

The tariffs come at a particularly dicey time for the U.S. economy. They could easily deal a further blow to consumer confidence, which already saw a sharp decline last month. Moreover, a sharp uptick in inflation could cause the Federal Reserve to hold the line on cutting interest rates, meaning less money in the pockets of home borrowers and less investment and expansion by companies faced with higher borrowing costs.

Tariffs will add weight to an alarming projection by the Atlanta Federal Reserve that we are headed from what was 3 percent growth to a 2.8 percent contraction this quarter. There is already generalized uncertainty and anxiety over the Trump administration’s policies. These include hundreds of thousands of across-the-board federal job cuts, the loss of critical research funding from the NIH, a threatened gutting of Medicaid and food assistance programs, the possibility of payment disruptions from Social Security, and a looming possibility of a federal shutdown in just over a week should Congressional House Republicans fail to agree upon a continuing resolution to fund the government. That’s just to name a few.

The technical economic term for all of this is a “shit show.” And Trump’s tariffs only deepen the economic cliff we may soon hurtle into.

Slavery was legal. Jim Crow was legal. The US Government paying reparations to white enslavers and not to the enslaved was legal. Prison slavery is still legal. The lesson is—do not let legality and power be a measure of morality and justice. And this is the lesson to remember now as the new MAGA government dismantles every semblance of a functioning society under the guise of “law and order.” Their acts are not only likely illegal, they are absolutely immoral and unjust. And unless we act with immediate urgency the damage done will be irreparable. What are these injustices, and how do we work with meaningful action to counter them? Let’s Address This.

In just a few weeks, the Trump administration has unleashed some of the most sweeping assaults on democracy, civil rights, and global stability in modern history. Every move has been calculated to entrench authoritarian control, whether by punishing law enforcement officials who prosecuted insurrectionists, dismantling public health protections, handing over government power to billionaires, criminalizing diversity and thought, or upending global trade agreements. These are not the actions of a democratic leader—they are the hallmarks of a fascist regime.

Here are seven of the most dangerous actions Trump has taken so far—and likewise—what actions can take to counter and protect from the harm he is causing.

1. Handing an Unelected Billionaire Control Over Americans’ Financial Data
Trump’s Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessant, has granted Elon Musk full access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems. Musk’s cronies have reportedly blocked out government officials from their own systems. This means Musk, a private billionaire with no official government position, now has direct access to:

Federal grant and loan distributions

Social Security and Medicare benefits records

Government contractor payments, including those that compete directly with Musk’s companies

This is blatant corruption. Musk previously publicly pressured Trump to fire the FAA administrator after the agency fined SpaceX for safety violations. The administrator was fired on January 20th. And we’ve already seen the devastation caused in air traffic. Two days later, Trump’s Treasury Department handed Musk access to the most sensitive financial data in the country.

A reminder once more that the President has zero authority to reallocate funds already appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose. And an unelected billionaire oligarch has even less than zero authority to hijack and reallocate funds.

If Musk were an elected official, this would be a massive conflict of interest. Instead, it’s something even worse: a billionaire oligarch being given unchecked power over Americans’ financial information. If any other nation on Earth did this we’d consider it a coup. And that’s what this is. This is a coup. A hostile takeover. A Constitutional crisis. Meanwhile, a reminder that 16 Democrats joined Republicans to confirm the billionaire hedge fund manager Bessant, who is now handing over the keys to our $28T economy to Musk.

2. Weaponizing the Justice System: Firing FBI Officials Who Investigated the Insurrection
This attempted purge of FBI officials involved in the prosecution of January 6th insurrectionists is of the most chilling early actions of the Trump regime. A reminder that Trump pardoned 1,500 white supremacist felons convicted for their role in the violent coup attempt. The people who stormed the Capitol in tactical gear, wore “Camp Auschwitz shirts,” beat police officers to death, and openly called to execute public officials are now free to walk the streets, while the law enforcement officials who held them accountable are being punished for doing their jobs.

Now, the Department of Justice has ordered the termination of eight senior FBI officials and demanded a list of every agent who worked on prosecuting January 6 insurrectionists. This is a direct authoritarian attack on law enforcement officials who dared to uphold the rule of law. In response, several of my contacts in the FBI leaked the following internal updates to me:

When told they were being fired, the FBI executives refused to leave. The Agents Association advised the Administration that it was unlawful by statute. They told the Administration they are required full formal OPR [Office of Professional Responsibility] adjudication before dismissals as we are not political appointees. So the Administration threatened that “we will OPR you” and all executives said “go for it.” Bottom line no one was walked out. The Administration backed down once they were threatened with legal action. They may OPR everyone but good luck with that. This makes me feel much better. Keeping you up to date.
One of the first rules in resisting autocracy is “do not comply in advance.” Therefore, it is encouraging to see that the targeted FBI officials have threatened legal action, which has temporarily halted the firings. The FBI has also refused to turn over the names of agents involved in January 6th cases until the DOJ provides a legal justification. As a reminder, this is the same tactic Trump used last week when he attempted to purge 17 Inspectors General. The IGs also responded by pointing out that Trump did not follow the legal procedure to fire them, and therefore refused to leave their posts. Finally, USDA Inspector General Phyllis Fong was forced to leave. This is courage in the face of fascism.

Clearly, Trump does not support law enforcement. He only supports law enforcement when it is a tool to uphold white supremacy and silence dissent.

3. Censoring Public Health: Erasing Critical Medical Information
The Trump regime has purged crucial public health resources from government websites, an action that medical experts warn will cost lives. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has removed:

Contraception guidance

HIV prevention and treatment resources

Studies on mental health in transgender and nonbinary communities

Data on bullying, suicide rates, and drug use in marginalized communities

The Infectious Diseases Society of America has condemned these removals, stating that erasing HIV information directly undermines efforts to end the epidemic, and will lead to more death. Indeed, as we still recover from the deadly COVID pandemic, we know all too well how stripping access to health resources costs lives. This move by the Trump regime will kill people, and sadly that appears to be the point.

4. Reviving Concentration Camps: 30,000 Migrants to Be Detained at Guantanamo Bay
Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is preparing to detain up to 30,000 migrants at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

This is not just a return to some of the darkest moments of U.S. history—it is an intentional echo of Executive Order 9066, which led to the mass internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Already we see reports of ICE illegally detaining U.S. citizens, assuming they are “illegal” because of the color of their skin. Meanwhile DHS Secretary Noem, whom 6 Democrats joined Republicans to confirm, is on the streets with ICE assisting, even as IC raids of schools and hospitals. Yes, even children are not spared this cruelty, including sick children. For example, the Children’s Hospital of Atlanta sent a notice to its entire staff to prepare for ICE raids, and provided guidance on how to remain calm when they show up. The Trump regime wants Americans to believe that “freedom” is targeting and arresting sick children at their most vulnerable point in life. Barbaric.

And for those who claim that “America is becoming 1930s Germany”, let’s remember that in the 1930s, Hitler sent his lawyers to study U.S. segregation laws, ultimately to model his own genocidal policies. America was Hitler’s blueprint, and shockingly, Hitler’s lawyers reported back to him that the U.S. segregation laws were in fact “too extreme, even for Nazis.” (The pre-eminent book on this topic is Hitler’s American Model by Princeton Professor James Q Whitman). Trump is not “copying 1930s Germany,” but reviving 1920s America—the America of Jim Crow, immigration bans, women’s oppression, and state-sanctioned racial violence.

That is what “MAGA” has always meant.

5. Shutting Down Humanitarian Aid: USAID Purge
The Trump regime has virtually dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)—the agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to people in crisis worldwide.

At least 56 senior USAID officials have been placed on administrative leave, while over $1 billion in critical aid has been frozen. This means:

Food assistance for starving children has been blocked

Medical aid for war-torn regions has been suspended

Disaster relief programs have been dismantled

All of this is being carried out under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom Democrats joined Republicans in unanimously confirming 99-0.

This is not just MAGA cruelty—it is bipartisan complacency.

6. Igniting a Trade War: Tariffs That Will Crush Consumers
Trump has recklessly imposed a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on all imports from China. These tariffs are scheduled to go live on Tuesday at midnight February 4 Let’s be clear: Tariffs are not paid by foreign governments or foreign companies. They are paid by American consumers. And unsurprisingly, Canada and Mexico have already announced retaliatory tariffs:

Canada is imposing 25% tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. exports

Mexico is planning tariffs on U.S. pork, cheese, fresh produce, and steel

This will skyrocket prices for consumers while crushing American businesses that rely on exports. Trump either doesn’t understand basic economics or doesn’t care how much working people suffer. At a time of historically high wealth and income inequality, this reckless move will further crush working people.

7. The Ideological Purge: Attacking DEI and Silencing Journalists
As I’ve documented before, Trump is purging non-white officials, political opponents, women, and journalists from federal agencies and the Pentagon. Specifically, since taking office, he has:

Canceled student visas for pro-Palestinian protesters, a clear First Amendment violation

Ordered Politico, the New York Times, and NBC to vacate their Pentagon offices, and has replaced them with OANN, Breitbart, and the New York Post—right wing outlets with a history of bias and disinformation

Attempted to force out federal employees who are not ideologically aligned with the “Trump agenda”

Purged all DEIA verbiage, actions, and initiatives from all Federal agencies, and openly demonized Black and brown people, disabled people, and women as the cause of America’s problems

This is not about government reform. It is about creating a one-party fascist state where Trump controls the media, purges opposition, and rules with unchecked power.

How Do We Respond With Meaningful Action?
“So what do we do?” is a question I receive dozens of times per day. I answer in detail below. To be sure, the worst thing we can do is give up. Autocrats want capitulation through exhaustion and compliance through fear. Do not give them that fuel.

Instead, in response to the 7 fascist actions cited above, I offer below 7 acts we can take to enact meaningful change for justice. Even if you don’t know where to begin or don’t have expendable funds, you can play a meaningful role. Some of these action items below have immediate effect and others take time. I ask you to engage in both.

Federal Employees — Use All Legal Means At Your Disposal: The eight FBI agent executives and the 17 Inspectors Generals refusing to comply in advance with unlawful firings are two excellent examples to follow. As federal employees, you have rights and protections. Contact employment attorneys in your area and speak to labor rights organizations. Understand your rights and know your rights. Get in good trouble, as John Lewis reminds us. Fight tooth and nail for your position, as your actions set a precedent for the future. Set the precedent of resisting autocratic terminations. Use your full constitutional protections to drag out every case imaginable and clog up the legal system for the Trump regime. If even 10% of the 2.3 million federal employees stand united and resist through the court system, you will slow down Trump autocracy. Do not capitulate to autocracy, combat autocracy with the full power of the law.

Democrats in Congress - Do Something More Than Tweet Your Outrage: Your constituents are angry, tired, and confused at your apathy, silence, and lack of organization. For your convenience, I have a short list of questions that should not be hard to answer:

Who is your party leader who should be coordinating all counter-fascism efforts and calling the shots on how to protect the American people?

Where are the daily press conferences and media blitzes documenting Trump’s fascism?

Where are the courageous protests by Members of Congress on the Capitol steps like former Congresswoman Cori Bush held in 2020 to protest the end of the rent moratorium during COVID?

Where are the Senate investigations into Trump’s corruption and Musk’s illegal access to the Treasury? How are you protecting our sensitive data?

Where are the guidances on what to do if our care is denied or the resources on getting accurate healthcare information removed from the CDC website? Where are the guidances if our SNAP, TANF, or Section 8 is denied?

Where are the barrage of lawsuits to clog up Trump’s fascist Executive Orders? For example, between lawsuits and floor votes, Republicans have attempted to repeal the ACA more than 100 times, even when in the minority, and now they might finally succeed in doing so. If Republicans can organize this effectively to strip our healthcare, why can’t you organize even half this effectively to protect our human rights?

Moreover, as Indivisible Co-Executive Director Leah Greenberg excellently said:

Democrats can oppose all Trump nominees, deny unanimous consent to slow senate proceedings, vote no on all cloture, force quorum calls at every chance. It’s a constitutional crisis. There is absolutely no reason the Senate should be connecting business as usual.

All of the above actions are wholly within Democrat control, even as the minority party—yet we see virtually none of it. Stop hiding behind the excuse of being a minority party, and start working with the awesome power of Congress afforded to you.

Everyone - Activate: Get involved in your local politics, which affects you more than most realize. Whether it is your local school board, your local city council, or your local immigrant rights organization—get involved. Show up to the next meeting, meet your local elected officials, and, for example, make sure you have a local policy on how to counter ICE raids in your local schools, shelters, and hospitals. Google is your friend in finding a local calendar of events. Use it.

Everyone - Communicate: Contact your member of Congress (find them here) and relentlessly remind them that you do not support Trump’s fascist agenda. Even if they are not willing to listen to you, inundate them with calls, texts, and emails. Ensure they hear your outrage as much as possible. Here’s a sample email to send to protest the illegal FBI firings (and illegal federal terminations in general):

Hi, my name is [insert name] and I live in [city/town/zip code]. I am a constituent of Congressman/Senators [name] and I am calling to strongly oppose the firing of any rank-and-file FBI agents, and any federal civil service employees, that are suspected to happen by the White House and DOJ. 

I am asking Congressman/Senator [name] to contact DOJ and White House leadership to demand they stop any planned action into these unjust firings and forced resignations. Unlike political appointees, line FBI agents are non-partisan federal government employees that are assigned to investigate any allegation of federal crime and they do so without any bias. Firings of these agents sets a dangerous precedent that retribution could take place if a rank-and-file FBI agent investigates a federal crime. This would fundamentally damage the core of our country’s premier law enforcement agency — that justice is blind. In addition, the mass firings of FBI agents would also indefinitely halt thousands of cases into violent criminals and gangs, drug tracking organizations and cartels, and terrorists, which is a something that this Administration has promised to focus on.

I strongly believe civil service protections for line FBI agents help them maintain independence from external influence or pressure from any outside group, person, or political party, no matter what side. This issue is of the upmost priority for my representative to take action on this immediately and is something I will pay close attention to as the upcoming elections come around.
Everyone - Invest: Invest your time and your money into the people and organizations doing the front line work. If you have time to volunteer, make phone calls, knock doors, and sign petitions, do so. If you have the financial resources to donate to organizations working to protect our democracy, especially local orgs, please do so. Even a few dollars a month, if you can afford it, goes a long way. And as always, consider running for office yourself. And especially if you’re under 40, reach out to Run For Something to get started.

Everyone - Educate: It is critical we remain informed on the key issues, by educating ourselves and those around us. As corporate media sadly continues to capitulate to fascism, support writers and human rights lawyers working to stop fascism in America (e.g. like yours truly). Read the work of non-profit media like ProPublica, The Appeal, and more. We may not have the billions of dollars in autocrat dark money, but we have strength in numbers and your support makes that difference.

Everyone - Organize: Bring friends with you. You are the best ambassador for justice in your friend group—lead by example. Grab even one friend and drag them with you to the next school board meeting, city council session, next phone banking session to an elected official, or town hall in your local community. We need to build organizational capacity, and means each one reaches one to get involved. This also means consider joining the General Strike that so far nearly 200,000 Americans have joined. The goal is to reach 11 million Americans. You can find out more at GeneralStrikeUS.

Conclusion
The Southern Strategy never stopped. Capitulation to MAGA fascism is made possible because so many are willing to embrace culture wars to distract from economic injustices as long as it gives them the perception of racial superiority over Black and brown people. We need to reject these culture wars and recognize that billionaire oligarchs will undermine the humanity in all of us, left or right, if it makes them a few extra bucks. We need unity in this time of crisis.

The only way to fight back is through relentless resistance, organization, and action, as I’ve described above. It is imperative we remember what justice looks like—because none of this is just—and continue to fight for that justice. I will continue to document and expose these autocratic attacks as they unfold, and I encourage you to act on the action items mentioned above. Again—do not let legality and power be a measure of morality and justice. And finally, I need and welcome your continued support to advance my human rights advocacy.

Resist. Activate. Communicate. Invest. Educate. Organize. Subscribe. And share. Thank you for your trust in this battle for democracy itself.

DeKalb County invests $21M to address the housing affordability crisis, 11 nonprofits to provide rent + utility assistance

The DeKalb County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to approve the measure during its meeting on Aug. 13.  

“The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a housing affordability crisis in our county,” CEO Thurmond said. “This multimillion-dollar investment will prevent and protect families from evictions from their rental homes and apartments.”

The DeKalb County Community Care Initiative will distribute $13 million to 11 nonprofit organizations to provide rental and utility assistance, employment assistance, training, mental health services, educational needs, food, childcare and legal services.

Through the DeKalb County Community Care Initiative, payments will be made toward rent and utilities by various DeKalb County nonprofits. Additionally, program participants will be provided case management to facilitate housing stability. Through case management, participants will be assessed and, if eligible, appropriately referred to additional supportive services available under HOME-ARP.

Participating nonprofit partners, along with their grant amounts and services they will provide, include:

New Life Community Ministries, $2.9 million, rent and utilities
Urban League of Greater Atlanta, $ 2.9 million, rent and utilities
Latin American Association, $2 million, rent and utilities

DeKalb County Government, $300,000, Coordinated Entry Services
Atlanta Legal Aid Society, $600,000, housing stability services
Jewish Family Career Services of Atlanta, $1 million, rent and utilities

The DeKalb County Community Care Initiative will distribute $13 million to 11 nonprofit organizations to provide rental and utility assistance, employment assistance, training, mental health services, educational needs, food, childcare and legal services.

Through the DeKalb County Community Care Initiative, payments will be made toward rent and utilities by various DeKalb County nonprofits. Additionally, program participants will be provided case management to facilitate housing stability. Through case management, participants will be assessed and, if eligible, appropriately referred to additional supportive services available under HOME-ARP.

Participating nonprofit partners, along with their grant amounts and services they will provide, include:

New Life Community Ministries, $2.9 million, rent and utilities
Urban League of Greater Atlanta, $ 2.9 million, rent and utilities
Latin American Association, $2 million, rent and utilities

DeKalb County Government, $300,000, Coordinated Entry Services
Atlanta Legal Aid Society, $600,000, housing stability services
Jewish Family Career Services of Atlanta, $1 million, rent and utilities
New American Pathways, $1.04 million, rent and utilities,
Africa’s Children Fund, $1 million, rent and utilities

Is there objection to the adoption of the Resolution? Chair hears none and the resolution is adopted. [Gavel strike.] I recognize the Senator from the 18th to introduce our special guest.

https://www.legis.ga.gov/members/senate/852?session=1031 

Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. We have the honor of receiving a lot of distinguished guests and visitors here at the Capitol and none are more fondly received than our friends from Ireland and it is my distinct honor to introduce the Minister here to you in just a moment.… Y'all please give a great Georgia Senate welcome to our friend from Ireland. 

3:50 Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment 
https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/who-we-are/ministers/peter-burke.html 

Thank you, Lieutenant Governor, President Pro Tempore, Senators. It is a privilege to be here with our team, our Consulate General Caoimhe Ní Chonchúir here behind me, Vice Consul Eimear Nolan deputy head, and our other colleagues here from Ireland. 
https://www.ireland.ie/en/usa/atlanta/about/consul-general/ 

It's a privilege to get this opportunity. I thank President Pro Tempore, Senator John F. Kennedy for the opportunity to facilitate me speaking to you here this morning which we really value as a country. It's a relationship — the U.S./Ireland relationship — that we really put resources behind that we treasure and it's demonstrated by this week about 20 cities hit between 11 ministers right across the U.S. and also we have our Consulate General here in Atlanta since 2010; 9 missions here in the U.S. and the best evidence of a good bilateral relationship is that it works both ways. And when you see Senator John F. Kennedy just alluded to here the FDI investment here in Georgia with 7,000 jobs really coming from Irish-backed companies — companies like CRH, like Kerry Food Group — working on the ground here in Georgia. 

Obviously for St. Patrick's weekend it's an incredible accolade for us to get the opportunity to speak to you here this morning to demonstrate the huge relationship borne out by about 9.5% of U.S. population, 32 million people claim an Irish heritage, a million people here in Georgia that we really value that relationship and we really nurture it into the future. I want to thank you for that, for being good friends, and for being there for us at very difficult times in the past like the Good Friday Agreement which was really assisted by the U.S. 

I just want to make two very brief points for our mission here in the U.S. this week which are very important to our foreign policy perspective. Firstly in relation to Ukraine, we believe it is critical that we stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. As a member of the European Union, this is the first war in a generation on mainland Europe. A country's territory integrity being challenged by Russian aggression has a right to self-determination a direct challenge on the international rules-based order and we really need to stand up to that. We've demonstrated by a 50 billion Euro package from Europe to assist Ukraine with its public services. So I really, really encourage everyone to keep up the resilience, to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. 

And secondly briefly just to mention the Middle East. We really abhor the acts of Oct. 7th on the State of Israel. We've demanded unequivocally the release of all hostages by Hamas which is very important to the Irish government. We also are one of the first parliamentary democracies to call for a ceasefire. We really believe we need to avoid proportionality, collective punishment on a very vulnerable people, and get humanitarian corridors opened up as quickly as possible. 

I want to acknowledge and thank the U.S. administration for working with us interlocutors in the region of which it has a very strong voice to encourage and secure such important humanitarian corridors and ceasefire to ensure that we can get back to the two-state solution right to the very forefront of our policy. 

And finally dear friends very important day is August 24th when Georgia Tech are coming to be victorious and to lead the stadium in Ireland. So, Go Yellow Jackets! Thank you.

Peterson speaks with the CEO of QOL Medical, Derick Cooper. They discuss how immunological systems confront pathogens and store information, the trait most associated with entrepreneurial success, the complicated patterns of behavior that scale from cellular interaction to metaphysics, and how a spirit of reciprocity can be utilized to uplift the individual as well as the community, society, and upward.

Derick Cooper is the Chief Executive Officer of QOL Medical, LLC, a large, private specialty biopharmaceutical company that makes drugs and biologics for rare diseases. QOL is a commercial stage company founded in 2003 with fully integrated capabilities ranging from sales and marketing to drug development to bioprocess-based manufacturing.

#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","hello everyone I'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early February and running through June Tammy and I an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the US you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information I'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas I've been working on my forthcoming book out November 2024 we who wrestle with God I'm looking forward to this I'm thrilled to be able to do it again and I'll be pleased to see all of you again soon byebye but you talked about sort of the concept of a of a a a reciprocity bank that's that's buil that's what reputation is yeah yeah that's what rep that's a good description yeah and and I think that so so if I go hunting you know it's it's 10,000 years ago and I go hunting and I'm successful and I share with with you well that now now we have mutual banking system we we have a a relationship that that transcends across time hello everyone today I have the opportunity to speak with Mr Derek Cooper dereck's the Chief Executive Officer of Q medical which is a private pharmaceutical company that specializes in the production of treatments and the origination of treatments for rare diseases so um you can understand how that properly done could be a very worthwhile Enterprise I've got to know Derek over the last few years um he volunteered to be of Aid to my Enterprise in whatever way might be useful a while back and after inves investigating his background a bit uh both Michaela my daughter and I reached out to him and we've established a very productive relationship we work together on Ralston College in Savannah Georgia and uh he's a benefactor of that institution and uh we've gone a number of adventures together in Greece with the people from Ralston College the students and and some of the other principles and benefactors and that's been extremely interesting I've i' I've had a lot of conversations with Derek about deep biological matters he's an expert in immunological function and as he's instructed me about the adaptations that the immunological system is capable of we've been able to work out a mapping of the manner in which the immunological system works to Stave off pathogens and the manner in which human thought and general behavioral adaptation progresses and that's one of the things that I wanted to share with everyone today and I think we did that quite effectively bringing the communication patterns of bees along for the ride it's very interesting you know to talk to someone whose knowledge is quite disparate from yours in some ways where where and and and still where the communication Still Remains in the boundaries of mutual comprehensibility and so I also walked Derek through his experiences as a businessman first working for a large baked Foods Enterprise and then as an investment banker we we tied that into our biological discussion as well talking about how experience can be mined to lead to what would you say the facilitation of broader and broader patterns of adaptation practically and conceptually and so that's all on the table in this discussion so welcome aboard Derek do you remember where we met and how I do um it was originally on Zoom actually I was sitting right here and uh Michaela introduced us I reached out to Michaela back when you were having some health issues um because I run a pharmaceutical company and and just have some access to resources and offered to help however I possibly could because I've over time um developed a lot of respect for what it is that you're you're doing in the world yeah well you have you have been a tremendous amount of help and so for everybody watching and listening I've worked with Derek since we've met to a large degree I suppose our most intensive collaboration has been with regards to Ralston College in Savannah and we'll talk about Ralston as we walk through this interview but dereck's also been very helpful in relation to the tour as well and has provided me with transportation and so forth when that's been and that's been extraordinarily helpful and we've also had a variety of extreme extremely productive conversations not least in Greece so I've traveled with Derek to Greece as part of her collaboration with Dr Steven Blackwood some of you watching and listening will be familiar with him as a consequence of The Exodus seminar and Dr Black Blackwood is president of Ralston college and um Derek is one of its supporters and developers and so we've traveled to Greece a number of times and gone to some remarkable places and had some amazing adventures and also had the opportunity to get to know each other at a conversational and personal level and the conversations have been extremely enlightening to me partly because Derek knows a lot of knows a lot in the biological realm especially with regard to immunological function that's something I really hope to touch on today and we found all sorts of interesting parallels between how the immune system works and how cognitive systems work and part of the reason I wanted to interview Derek today apart from the fact that he's an interesting character on the entrepreneurial side as well as the cognitive side is because of what he knows on the biological front I thought that would be really interesting to bring to people's attention so let's start if you don't mind let's start with your company do you want to describe it and describe its scale and and exactly what you do sure yeah so it's a midsize may maybe large private specialty biopharmaceutic company we make drugs for rare diseases so so we focus primarily on genetic diseases and therapies for those diseases which involve understanding the sort of genetic background for why those diseases may occur and then once you sort of capture that biological um dynamism you you investigate how you can possibly counter whatever may may be going wrong so um the scale of our company we have couple hundred employees um primarily in the US although we do have some European operations and we sort of run the gamut from the the manufacturing side we have inhouse to sales and Commercial operations as well as um clinical development Etc so we do fully integrated biopharmaceutical company so you told me at one time paradoxically that there's nothing rare about rare diseases when you take them in there in their cumulative sense so maybe you could explain to everybody what that means yeah so I think that a rare disease in the US at least is defined as a disease that less than 200,000 people have um and typically rare diseases are are rare e each Silo each disease is rare because um they tend to be fairly impactful to human health and and can cause real problems and so when they're when they are more significant in terms of human health it's they're less likely to have survived through evolutionary history so each rare disease in and of itself is unique but and and relatively small uh in terms of the prevalence or the number of people that that would have the disease but overall the total people with rare diseases if you add up all of the categories of each individual disease is pretty pretty substantial um and another thing that's happening just as we as we evolve in the industry and learn more about the genetic background of different diseases what we're learning is that they have implications for other diseases so so a rare disease that impacts COG nitive function for example we find that that maybe minor mutations with something like that could have a broader impact on a dis disease like dementia for example there there the two could be related and so then you you learn about the um disease in in a broader context by focusing on the on the sort of hyp severe portion of the right well well that's that's I suppose in some ways that's almost a scientific truism because it turns out that because everything is ultimately connected if you investigate anything deeply enough even something rare you start to find commonalities between what you're and and associations between what you're studying and all sorts of things that are relevant in the broader world one of the things you see in the careers of scientists often is that you know they start out to some degree maybe when they're undergraduates as generalists then they specialize intensely on a phenomenon that that might seem trivial because of its of its particular specificity genetic mutations and fruit flies I suppose comes to mind but as the scientist develops his or her career and starts to approach the limits of their cognitive ability the connections between what they're studying and everything else start to become more and more apparent to them and as their careers progress they become broader and broader in their range of knowledge and and I think that's a this is partly why I think it's possible for people to follow what they're interested in and to do that effectively because if you follow what you're interested in even if it's a pinpoint it'll lead you to if you do it properly and in a disciplined Manner and striving uphill it'll lead you to wherever you want to go and I guess this is partly also what happened to you I and I'm kind of interested in that on the autobiographical front because you started out in Investment Banking you were in investment banking for 16 years right so maybe walk us through that and tell tell everybody how it is that you your interests transformed across that period of time and how you ended up first of all in Investment Banking and then out of it and then into the company that you that you now run yeah so so when I left undergraduate school at at Washington and Lee I I started in what's called corporate finance and Investment Banking which is uh sort of the the capital raising side we we would help small and midsize companies uh go public or raise debt and and uh execute on an acquisition that kind of thing um and then I ended up uh moving to a um I moved to a family-owned business that my father uh had built after working for a good-sized Fortune 500 company for for many years he left in the late 80s and started his own company in the baked Foods business of all things so I I moved into the operations of a baked Foods business it was a good-sized company we had 2500 employees at one point um operations throughout the southeast um we then sold that company about 10 years later so in the late 90s I worked for that company for a while and and after we sold it I went to work for a company in in Nashville Tennessee actually which was a Mez was called a mezanine capital it's basically um helping invest in small companies so they can they can grow um at the time it was a lot of fun it was right in the uh sort of peak of the internet craze so we were chaos would be the defining characteristic of what was happening in the capital markets at the time and so we're um making a lot of investments in a lot of different small companies um and then uh that company was sold and I I sort of talked to my family and some friends and we ended up putting together a a private uh Equity investment company that ultimately made an investment in this pharmaceutical company in 2003 and then I just I was on the board initially and got to know the company and then joined the company full-time in 2010 as CEO and have been there ever since so when you started out in the baked Foods company what did you what what did you what did that teach you what did that teach you about business and what and so what did it teach you personally what did it teach you about business and what did it teach you that enabled you to make the move to the investment banking side of things and then into the pharmaceutical industry so you because the the reason I'm asking I suppose is because you have an intellectual interest that will explore in relationship to biology but you also have business knowledge and interest that enables you to not only investigate cognitively let's say and conceptually but to run a business successfully and profitably and to manage people while doing that and that's a you know that's not an obviously overlapping skill set so I'm curious to pull out the threads and to explain you know how both of those abilities developed so let's go on the business side first you started with this baked goods Bak baked Foods company yeah so I I think I think maybe it is more of an overlapping skill set because a a bank Foods company is defined by sort of a hyperco competitive environment and it's very much what I would call a cost driven business and what what I mean by that is you have to watch your cost very very carefully because the margins are thin there's a lot of competition we basically were producing a very high volume of like white bread and the the the basic stuff that you get on the Shelf in in a Walmart grocery store white bread and wheat bread and hot dog and hamburger buns and distributing them to I mean we had a facility in BD North Carolina they would make 50,000 pounds of an hour just to just to put some perspective on this so uh because of that fairly low margin cost- driven business you have to manage the hierarchy of costs really really precisely because anything that sort of grows or gets out of control can can be in terms of the the cost of the business so it's it's sort of the the extreme side of pencil sharpening um I would say I would say the pharmaceutical business by ju toos is almost the complete opposite it is driven by um a focus on the intellectual property development around a unique approach to treating a particular disease which is highly complex and uh requires an extraordinary amount of of thaning to to ju poos the two and the the consequence of that is that uh the the margins in the industry are just just completely different because the investment comes on developing the product and the and the patent portfolio around the product and that kind of thing as opposed to managing the cost explicitly but but your question's a good one it's not one I've thought about before because one of the things that we do somewhat uniquely with our company is we we manage our costs pretty rigorously even though we don't necessarily have to because because it is a more Pro profitable business than baked foods for example but what I found in in doing that is that it it limits chaos because if you if you sort of are continuously hyperfocusing on what it is that is your goal and make sure that you are um not allowing noise to enter the situation in pursuit of that goal it it well it's highly correlated with success to be to be focused and and not allow the organization to to become too chaotic in pursuit of a goal is yeah so so I'm I'm trying to think of that from a psychological and a trait perspective I mean we we know very well that success in complex Endeavors is primarily dependent on intelligence but that personality trait variance also plays a role and so when you're talking about very tight cost control I immediately think of two things and one is conscientiousness that's the ability to pay attention that's orderliness and industri the ability to and willingness and desire for that matter to pay attention to details so Details Matter and I would also suspect a certain degree of disagreeable disagreeableness too because when you're talking about control of costs let's say to me and this is partly practical experience speaking that also means the ability to say no right and control implies no right right so but then on the product development side let's say with regards to the pharmaceutical industry that seems to be more something associated with high levels of openness and creativity interest in intellectual matters and so that that's a relatively rare combination extremely high openness and I know that's characteristic of you because I've talked to you a lot and you're unbelievably interested in ideas but you're also extremely detail oriented so that's a relatively rare overlap of traits and so um it sounds to me like you really did when when you were working with the in the in the baked Foods industry did you did you enjoy the the detail management that was associated with keeping the company functional despite it being lean no no that was that was not something that I found interesting it it's it's necessary and I understood the value U from a good management perspective but but uh I do I am a bit of a chaos Seeker In from from an openness perspective I do like to explore new ideas and so an overly ordered organization is not is not Optimum for me as we head toward a presidential election in November one thing you can be sure of 2024 will be a tumultuous year how will your hard-earned savings fair you already see the impacts of inflation at the pump in the grocery store the dollar continues to lose buying power quicker than wages can increase so how are you protecting your savings consider diversifying with gold from the Birch gold group for decades gold has been the choice of investors in C central banks to hedge against inflation if you have an IRA or 401K from a previous employer that's just Gathering dust call Birch gold and they will help you convert it into an IRA in Gold you won't pay a penny out of pocket they will simply convert that 401k into physical gold which unlike digital currency can't be tampered with just text Jordan to 98 9898 and Birch gold will send you a free info kit on gold with an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau thousands of satisfied customers in the exclusive gold company of the daily wire for the past 7 years you can trust Birch gold 2 text Jordan to 9898917350 conscientious and that you have a certain degree of emotional resilience so you're low in neuroticism those are the best predictors on the managerial front on the entrepreneurial front the best predictors are intelligence once again because that's Universal across any domain that's complex but o trait openness and openness is basically aesthetic appreciation on the one hand and interest in ideas and intellectual exploration on the other and my empirical investigations into predicting entrepreneurship showed quite clearly that the major trait predictor there was openness by a substantial margin and so it sounds to me like you when you were in your baked Foods um Incarnation let's say that there was plenty of room there for conscientiousness but not necessarily as much room as you have now for the investigation into well into deep problems the intellectual investigation is that fair that's fair that's a very good description okay okay but it TR but it trained you yeah I I think that there's a um if you're a very open person it's good to work on the discipline you know if if you're if you're in a role like a CEO ultimately your responsibility is strategic you you need to be looking ahead and deciding where the organ is going and what it is that you're going to do and and how you get there and but you have to learn to constrain your own openness in terms of seeking those things because if you don't you will become the biggest source of Chaos in the organization because very open people tend to be well open to lots of different ideas and so you you if you can discipline yourself on that front first then I think that that it propagates throughout the organization ultimately and it's it's like anything you have to draw the boundary between Chaos and Order yeah yeah intelligently matter of fact I think you could even Define competence that way as the sort of optimum Dynamic um positioning of the boundy between Order and Chaos depending on the circumstances and it does change because do do you have do you have any idea how in your present business you make a decision about so okay so if you're open Any Given idea has a high probability of triggering a set of associated ideas and the more open you are the larger the Gap is between the ideas that are triggered so in fact when you're talking to highly open People they'll jump from one topic to another and if you're less open you may not understand that there's any connection between those ideas at all now the advantage to that is that you bring things together that are not normally conceptualized together and and also you're a seeker of multiple Pathways but the disadvantage as as you're inferring or even pointing out is that well if you have 40 if you have 30 open people working on a project there's going to be like 900 ideas a day and some of those might even be great ideas but the problem is is that well most great ideas are still going to fail pursuit of any great idea is unbelievably timec consuming and costly and you can't do everything at once and so how have you learned do you think to distinguish between the ideas that attract your interest that are worth pursuing and the ideas that attract your interest that are you know that you have to let fall by the wayside and you know how have you learned to deal with that conceptually but also practically right because you can have people around you that can help you with that too so how have you solved that problem given your openness yeah yeah you know that's a good question I I hadn't really thought about it before I I think that what what occurs is is a process of sort of aligning the opportunity with with the relevant sacrifice that you have to um in the in the investment world we call it good Capital allocation so so the way that you do this with Investments is you sort of create a hierarchy of your opportunities and whatever is at the top of the hierarch your very best opportunity where you can get the best return you put as much resource into that opportunity fill that bucket first before you allow um War Warren Buffett says this in an extraordinarily uh py manner he says you know when you're 25 years old down and write down the top 25 goals that you have for your life draw a line under number five tear the page off keep the top five and don't ever change and don't do anything else I mean you can make you know some changes but but it's a it's a capturing of this concept of high focus yeah and so I I think you have to uh if you have an extraordinary opportunity you're willing to direct more sacrifice to that to that opportunity as you should and so it's a it's a it's a mathematical it's a math Mathes balancing of the equation of how good is the opportunity and how much is it going to cost to pursue it right right well so so there's a number of avenues of exploration that are gerain to that observation so one is so if you talk to managers of small and large companies about what frustrates them one of the things you find very rapidly is they're frustrated by the constant necessity of having to put out fires so they're so busy dealing with like Crisis minutia that they never get a chance to strategize over the long run or even to sit down and think about what a reasonable medium to long-term strategy is and that is not productive but part of the reason is this is that the typical manager so the typical manager first of all fails the empirical estimates are that 65% of managers add negative net value to their companies right so that's a pretty damning that and that's a pretty damning statistic yeah I do think that's mostly chaos well well that's that that's so what happens to managers very frequently is that they spend the majority of their time with their worst employees and so the perverse management strategy which is well documented empirically is that you do the same thing with your employees that you do with your goals according to your description which is you figure out the people who are Stellar performers and you spend all your time with them and part of the reason is is that the payoff as a consequence of facilitating your Stellar um employees or Partners let's say is exponential and not L linear here and so also the probability that if you're dealing with problem employees that you're going to be able to do anything for them in the medium to long run is extremely low you don't have the time or the energy and they may not have the inclination I mean managers aren't clinical psychologists and their employees aren't people who are coming to them for psychological help so there's an analogy there know and the other thing yep yeah yeah I think that that's directionally part partially correct I might say it a little bit different I I I think that um you you yeah at at a high level it's it's definitely a par distribution and you want to you want to focus your time and energy on the sort of uber competent people that can get a lot of things done but you you need to build a functional organization that has a lot of different people and a lot of different roles and and you can't do that by saying well we're just going to focus on you know these two or three Superstars and and and hope everything else works out you you you have to you have to understand how the entire organization functions up and down the hierarchy and and I would say that that chaos to me if if things start going wrong in an in some element of the organization it it's you know the sort of hyper manager uh conscientiousness types that you're describing they want to just get rid of the chaos they don't want any change they don't want they don't want anything to sort of disturb the organization and I don't I don't think that's actually exactly right I I think there's more subtlety to it I think that when you know and sort of the sign of chaos to me is that the idea proliferation just kind of starts to go crazy you get all these well maybe we should do this maybe they're competing ideas they they um the the and that's a sign of I think in in the business context a sign of one of two two different things either you have not communicated the goal clearly as a leader or or you don't have the right goal and and people aren't sure what to do and and so they're they're actually doing the right thing in the sense that if you don't know what to do and what you are doing isn't working changing is a good idea now you that doesn't mean that you necessarily are changing in the right direction because you may or may not have access to or be privy to what is going on and other aspects of the organization but it's a to me it's a sign it's a smoke signal of something that you need to pay attention to and the other thing that I typically I see that that causes chaotic behavior is people have a goal the goal is relatively clear and they realize they're not going to be able to make the goal and so there's sort of a a fear or threat aspect that that's starting to occur and they feel like whatever it is that they're doing isn't working and they need to make a change in order to make sure that they're successful so both in a sense both of those reactions are correct but you you need to understand what it is that's motivating the person to sort of change direction uh so that you can either help them get to the goal or make sure that the goal is clear um and it's not I it's not necessarily just that that there's a misalignment of competence I think would which was your description I mean it could be well I well I I guess I I I'm also wondering it it it may be the case as well it's complicated when it comes to intelligence because intelligent people tend to perform better wherever they're put if it's complex but you could imagine a situation where there's a lot of different sub games in your corporate environment and they're all necessary so maybe there's a distinction let's say between sales and research so that's a good distinction the the the great people on the sales side aren't going to be the same people who are the great people on the research side absolutely so right so there's going to be there's going to be a distribution of competence by specialized bin I mean one of the things we know psychologically about specialized bins let's say for example because you might ask yourself well how do you conceptualize the different what does it mean for an occupation to be different from another occupation right because obviously nurse and Doctor are similar but probably you know doctor and and and uh and graphic artists aren't that similar and so it BS the question of what constitutes similarity and interest seems to be relevant in that regard right are empirical yeah you know I I think that um your goal is to is to run an uh any organization but well I'll focus on a pharmaceutical company if you want to run it well you absolutely need to understand people and I think that uh one of the things that you've been tremendously helpful to me with is things like the Big Five personality profile and understand myself and and I think if if you can understand what it is that you're good at and what it is that you are not good at and there there's a key component to that which I I would describe as epistemic humility you you have to know the boundary of what you know and what you don't know and and if you can fill in the gap or if you if you can understand that and fill in the Gap properly then you can the organization will function better because right right because you're you're sort of aligning different skill sets appropriately with what needs to be done so I think and you know another key component to this I would say I've learned from listening to you is that because different people perceive the world differently they there's the com you have to understand at least somewhat you have to have some concept of what their reference for because if you're a highly ordered um you know conscientious person then someone who's A Creative Marketing person you it's almost a different language in terms of how those people view the world and so you need to sort of uh you need to align the way that you communicate with the recipient of the of the communication because um I mean it literally is almost like a different language right right well and and you know we we hear a lot of squawking about diversity in the culture wars that are raging but there is relevant appreciation for diversity and real true diversity is actually diversity of temperament because we know there are five temperaments dimensions of temperament we know they're normally distributed and we know that there are different skills associated with them and and that those differences are real so we know for example if you're extroverted rather than introverted you're going to be motivated by social interaction and it's going to energize you rather than innovating you and it's highly probable especially if you're involved in sales this isn't invariable the case but it's highly likely that like sales especially sales that involve a lot of presentations are meeting a lot of people a lot of group presentations that's much more suitable for someone who's extroverted now extroverts can also be impulsive and and and in extreme in the extreme you know there's pathologies associated with every skill they can also you know that can degenerate into mania you don't get anything without a cost but it is extremely useful to know that people are actually different you know the people who are higher neuroticism they're going to be much more sensitive to threat and so you can imagine that that would be one of the things that would stop them from taking risks and that might be a very bad thing on the strictly entrepreneurial side but you might imagine too that having a few people around that who serve as canaries in the coal mine could also be extremely useful and agreeableness is particularly interesting in that regard because there are really pronounced advantages and disadvantages at the ends of the distribution so dis agreeable people they're they're much more likely to bargain hard for themselves so they're going to be formidable competitors and they're going to be super blunt and they can be blunt enough to to to be offensive

"," [♪ INTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Hello, everyone. Today, I have the opportunity to speak with Mr. Derek Cooper. Derek's the Chief Executive Officer of QOL Medical, which is a private pharmaceutical company that specializes in the production of treatments and the origination of treatments for rare diseases. So you can understand how that property done could be very worthwhile enterprise. I got to know Derek over the last few years. He volunteered to be of aid to my enterprise in whatever way might be useful a while back. And after investigating his background a bit, both McKayla, my daughter, and I reached out to him and we've established a very productive relationship. We worked together on Ralston College in Savannah, Georgia. And he's a benefactor of that institution. And we've gone a number of adventures together in Greece with the people from Ralston College, the students, and some of the other principals and benefactors. And that's been extremely interesting. I've had a lot of conversations with Derek about deep biological matters. He's an expert in immunological function. And as he's instructed me about the adaptations that the immunological system is capable of, we've been able to work out a mapping of the manner in which the immunological system works to stave off pathogens and the manner in which human thought and general behavioral adaptation progresses. And that's one of the things that I wanted to share with everyone today. And I think we did that quite effectively, bringing the communication patterns of bees along for the ride. It's very interesting to talk to someone whose knowledge is quite disparate from yours in some ways. And still, where the communication still remains in the boundaries of mutual comprehensibility. And so I also walked Derek through his experiences as a businessman first working for large baked foods, enterprise, and then as an investment banker, we tied that into our biological discussion as well, talking about how experience can be mine to lead to what would you say, the facilitation of broader and broader patterns of adaptation, practically and conceptually. And so that's all on the table in this discussion. So welcome aboard. Derek, do you remember where we met and how? I do. It was originally on Zoom, actually, I was sitting right here. And Michaela introduced us. I reached out to Michaela back when you were having some health issues, because I run a pharmaceutical company and just have some access to resources and offered to help, however, I possibly could, because I've over time developed a lot of respect for what it is that you're doing in the world. Yeah, well, you have been a tremendous amount of help. And so for everybody watching and listening, I've worked with Derek since we've met to a large degree, I suppose our most intensive collaboration has been with regards to Ralston College in Savannah. And we'll talk about Ralston as we walk through this interview. But Derek's also been very helpful in relation to the tour as well, and has provided me with transportation and so forth. And that's been extraordinarily helpful. And we've also had a variety of extremely productive conversations, not least in Greece. So I've traveled with Derek to Greece as part of our collaboration with Dr. Steven Blackwood. Some of you watching and listening will be familiar with him as a consequence of the Exodus seminar on Dr. Blackwood, his president of Ralston College. And Derek is one of its supporters and developers. And so we've traveled to Greece a number of times and gone to some remarkable places and had some amazing adventures and also had the opportunity to get to know each other at a conversational and personal level. And the conversations have been extremely enlightening to me, partly because Derek knows a lot in the biological realm, especially with regard to immunological function. That's something I really hope to touch on today. And we've found all sorts of interesting parallels between how the immune system works and how cognitive systems work. And part of the reason I wanted to interview Derek today, apart from the fact that he's an interesting character on the entrepreneurial side, as well as the cognitive side, is because of what he knows on the biological front. I thought that would be really interesting to bring to people's attention. So let's start. If you don't mind, let's start with your company. Do you want to describe it and describe its scale and exactly what you do? Sure. Yeah. So it's a midsize, maybe large private specialty bio pharmaceutical company. We make drugs for rare diseases. So we focus primarily on genetic diseases and therapies for those diseases, which involve understanding the sort of genetic background for why those diseases may occur. And then once you capture that biological dynamism, you investigate how you can possibly counter whatever may be going wrong. So the scale of our company, we have a couple hundred employees, primarily in the US, although we do have some European operations. And we sort of run the gamut from the manufacturing side. We have in-house to sales and commercial operations, as well as clinical development, et cetera. So we do fully integrated bio pharmaceutical company. So you told me at one time paradoxically that there's nothing rare about rare diseases when you take them in their cumulative sense. So maybe you could explain to everybody what that means. Yeah. So I think that a rare disease in the US at least is defined as a disease that less than 200,000 people have. And typically rare diseases are rare. Each silo, each disease is rare because they tend to be fairly impactful to human health. And can cause real problems. And so when they are more significant in terms of human health, it's they're less likely to have survived through evolutionary history. So each rare disease in and of itself is unique, and relatively small in terms of the prevalence or the number of people that would have the disease. But overall, the total people with rare diseases, if you add up all of the categories of each individual disease, is pretty substantial. And another thing is happening just as we evolve in the industry and learn more about the genetic background of different diseases, what we're learning is that they have implications for other diseases. So a rare disease that impacts cognitive function, for example, we find that maybe minor mutations or something like that could have a broader impact on a disease like dementia, for example. The two could be related. And so then you learn about the disease in a broader context by focusing on the sort of hyper severe portion of the... Right, well, that's I suppose in some ways that's almost a scientific truism because it turns out that because everything is ultimately connected, if you investigate anything deeply enough, even something rare, you start to find commonalities between what you're... And associations between what you're studying and all sorts of things that are relevant to the broader world. One of the things you see in the careers of scientists often is that they start out to some degree, maybe when they're undergraduates, as generalists. Then they specialize intensely on a phenomenon that might seem trivial because of its particular specificity, genetic mutations and fruit flies, I suppose, comes to mind. But as the scientist develops his or her career and starts to approach the limits of their cognitive ability, the connections between what they're studying and everything else start to become more and more apparent to them and as their careers progress, they become broader and broader in their range of knowledge. And I think that's it. This is partly why I think it's possible for people to follow what they're interested in and to do that effectively because if you follow what you're interested in, even if it's a pinpoint, it'll lead you to... If you do it properly and in a disciplined manner and striving uphill, it'll lead you to wherever you wanna go. And I guess this is partly also what happened to you. And I'm kind of interested in that on the autobiographical front because you started out in investment banking, you were in investment banking for 16 years, right? So maybe walk us through that and tell everybody how it is that you, your interests, transformed across that period of time and how you ended up, first of all, in investment banking and then out of it and then into the company that you now run. So when I left undergraduates school at Washington and Lee, I started in what's called corporate finance in investment banking, which is sort of the capital raising side. We would help small and mid-sized companies go public or raise debt and execute on an acquisition, that kind of thing. And then I ended up moving to a family owned business that my father had built after working for a good size, Fortune 500 company for many years. He left in the late 80s and started his own company in the baked foods business of all things. So I moved into the operations of a baked food business. It was a good size company. We had 2500 employees at one point. Operations throughout the southeast. We didn't sold that company about 10 years later. So in the late 90s, I worked for that company for a while and after we sold it, I went to work for a company in Nashville, Tennessee, actually, which was a, it was called a Mezzanade Capital. It's basically helping invest in small companies so they can grow. At the time, it was a lot of fun. It was right in the sort of peak of the internet craze. So we were, okay, that would be the defining characteristic of what was happening in the capital markets at the time. And so we're making a lot of investments in a lot of different small companies. And then that company was sold and I sort of talked to my family and some friends and we ended up putting together a private equity investment company that ultimately made an investment in this pharmaceutical company in 2003. And then I just, I was on the board initially, and got to know the company and then joined the company full-time in 2010. The CEO had been there ever since. So when you started out in the big foods company, what did you, what did you, what did that teach you? What did that teach you about business? And what, and so what did it teach you personally? What did it teach you about business? And what did it teach you that enabled you to make the move to the investment banking side of things and then into the pharmaceutical industry? So you, because the reason I'm asking, I suppose is because you have an intellectual interest that will explore in relationship to biology, but you also have business knowledge and interest that enables you to not only investigate cognitively, let's say, and conceptually, but to run a business successfully and profitably and to manage people while doing that. And that's a, you know, that's not an obviously overlapping skill set. So I'm curious to pull out the threads and to explain, you know, how both of those abilities developed. So let's go on the business side first. You started with this big, big, big foods company. Yes, so I think maybe it is more of an overlapping skill set because a big foods company is defined by sort of a hyper competitive environment. And it's very much what I would call a cost driven business. And what I mean by that is you have to watch your costs very, very carefully, because the margins are thin. There's a lot of competition. We basically were producing a very high volume of like white bread. But the basic stuff that you get on the shelf and in a Walmart grocery store, white bread and wheat bread and hot dog and hamburger buns and distributing them to, I mean, we had a facility in Valdez, North Carolina, that would make 50,000 pounds an hour just to put some perspective on this. So because of that fairly low margin cost driven business, you have to manage the hierarchy of costs really, really precisely. Because anything that sort of grows or gets out of control can be disastrous in terms of the cost of the business. So it's sort of the extreme side of pencil sharpening. I would say the pharmaceutical business by juxtaposition is almost the complete opposite. It is driven by a focus on the intellectual property development around a unique approach to treating a particular disease, which is highly complex and requires an extraordinary amount of, of, thanking to juxtapose the two. And the consequence of that is that the margins in the industry are just completely different because the investment comes on developing the product and the patent portfolio around the product and that kind of thing as opposed to managing the costs explicitly. But your question is a good one. It's not what I've thought about before, because one of the things that we do somewhat uniquely with our company is we manage our costs pretty rigorously, even though we don't necessarily have to, because it is a more profitable business than baked foods for example. But what I've found in doing that is that it limits chaos, because if you sort of are continuously hyper focusing on what it is that is your goal and make sure that you are not allowing noise to enter the situation and pursuit of that goal, it, well, is highly correlated with success, to be focused and not allow the organization to become too chaotic and pursuit of a goal is.

Yeah, so I'm trying to think of that from a psychological and a trait perspective. I mean, we know very well that success in complex endeavors is primarily dependent on intelligence, but that personality trait variants also plays a role. And so when you're talking about very tight cost control, I immediately think of two things. And one is conscientiousness. That's the ability to pay attention. That's orderliness and industrious. The ability to and willingness and desire for that matter to pay attention to details. So details matter. And I would also suspect a certain degree of disagreeable, disagreeableness too, because when you're talking about control of costs, let's say, to me, and this is partly practical experience speaking, that also means the ability to say no. And control applies. No, right. So, but then on the product development side, let's say with regards to the pharmaceutical industry, that seems to be more something associated with high levels of openness and creativity and interest in intellectual matters. And so that's a relatively rare combination, extremely high openness. And I know that's characteristic of you, because I've talked to you a lot, and you're unbelievably interested in ideas. But you're also extremely detailed oriented. So that's a relatively rare overlap of traits. And so it sounds to me like you really did when you were working with the in the in the baked foods industry, did you did you enjoy the the detail management that was associated with keeping the company functional, despite it being lean? No, no. That was that was not something that I found interesting. It's it's necessary and I understood the value from a good management perspective. But I do I am a bit of a chaos seeker in from from an openness perspective. I do like to explore new ideas. And so an overly ordered organization is not is not optimum for me. Right. So you weren't you weren't fundamentally interested in so for everyone listening and watching. If your temperamentally suited to be a manager, let's say, what that means most basically is that you're intelligent and that you're conscientious and that you have a certain degree of emotional resilience. So you're low in your autism. Those are the best predictors on the managerial front. On the entrepreneurial front, the best predictors are intelligence once again, because that's universal across any domain that's complex. But oh, trait openness and openness is basically aesthetic appreciation on the one hand and interest in ideas and intellectual exploration on the other. And my empirical investigations into predicting entrepreneurship showed quite clearly that the major trait predictor there was openness by a substantial margin. And so it sounds to me like you when you were in your baked foods incarnation, let's say that there was plenty of room there for conscientiousness, but not necessarily as much room as you have now for the investigation into well into deep problems. The intellectual investigation. Is that fair? That's fair. That's a very good description. Okay. Okay. But it tripped, but it trained you. Yeah, I think that there's a, if you're a very open person, it's good to work on the discipline. If you're all like a CEO, ultimately your responsibility is strategic. You need to be looking ahead and deciding where the order is going and what it is that you're going to do and how you get there. But you have to learn to constrain your own openness in terms of seeing those things, because if you don't, you will become the biggest source of chaos in the organization, because very open people tend to be well open to lots of different ideas. And so you, if you can discipline yourself on that front first, then I think that it propagates throughout the organization ultimately. And it's like anything, you have to draw the boundary between chaos and order. Yeah. Yeah. Intelginally. As a matter of fact, I think you could even define confidence that way as the sort of optimum dynamic positioning of the boundary between order and chaos, depending on the circumstances. And it does change. Do you have any idea how in your present business, you make a decision about, so, okay, so if you're open, any given idea has a high probability of triggering a set of associated ideas. And the more open you are, the larger the gap is between the ideas that are triggered. So in fact, when you're talking to highly open people, they'll jump from one topic to another. And if you're less open, you may not understand that there's any connection between those ideas at all. Now, the advantage to that is that you bring things together that are not normally conceptualized together. And also you're a seeker of multiple pathways. But the disadvantage as you're inferring or even pointing out is that, well, if you have 40, if you have 30 open people working on a project, there's going to be like 900 ideas a day. And some of those might even be great ideas. But the problem is is that, well, most great ideas are still going to fail pursuit of any great ideas, unbelievably time consuming and costly. And you can't do everything at once. And so how have you learned, do you think, to distinguish between the ideas that attract your interest that are worth pursuing and the ideas that attract your interest that are, you know, that you have to let fall by the wayside. And, you know, how have you learned to deal with that conceptually, but also practically, right? Because you can have people around you that can help you with that too. So how have you solved that problem given your openness? Yeah, yeah, you know, that's a good question. I hadn't really thought about it before. I think that what occurs is is a process of sort of aligning the opportunity with with the relevant sacrifice that you have to, in the investment world, we call it good capital allocation. So the way that you do this with investments is you sort of create a hierarchy of your opportunities. And whatever is at the top of the hierarchy, you're very best opportunity where you can get the best return. You put as much resource into that opportunity, fill that bucket first. Before you allow, Warren Buffett actually says this in an extraordinarily pithy manner. He says, you know, when you're 25 years old, down and right down the top $25 that you have for your life, draw a line under number five, tear the page off, keep the top five and don't ever change and don't do anything else. I mean, you can make some changes, but it's a capturing of this concept of high-prepocus. I think you have to, if you have an extraordinary opportunity, you're willing to direct more sacrifice to that opportunity as you should. And so it's a mathematical, it's a mass-ass balancing of the equation of how good is the opportunity and how much is it going to cost to pursue it. Right. Right. Well, so there's a number of avenues of exploration that are germane to that observation. So one is, so if you talk to managers of small and large companies about what frustrates them, one of the things you find very rapidly is they're frustrated by the constant necessity of having to put out fires. So they're so busy dealing with like crisis minutia that they never get a chance to strategize over the long run or even to sit down and think about what a reasonable medium to long-term strategy is and that is not productive. But part of the reason is this is that the typical manager, so the typical manager, first of all, fails. The empirical estimates are that 65% of managers add negative net value to their companies. Right. So that's a pretty damning statistic. Yeah. Do you think that's mostly chaos? Well, well, well, that's that's that's so what happens to managers very frequently is that they spend the majority of their time with their worst employees. And so the perverse management strategy, which is well documented empirically, is that you do the same thing with your employees that you do with your goals according to your description, which is you figure out the people who are stellar performers and you spend all your time with them. And part of the reason is that the payoff as a consequence of facilitating your stellar employees or partners, let's say, is exponential and not linear. And so also the probability that if you're dealing with problem employees that you're going to be able to do anything for them in the medium to long run is extremely low. You don't have the time or the energy and they may not have the inclination. I mean, managers aren't clinical psychologists and their employees aren't people who are coming to them for psychological help. So there's an analogy there, you know, and the other thing I think, yep. Yeah. I think that that's directionally partially correct. I might say it a little bit different. I think that you do, yeah, at a high level, it's definitely a parado distributional. And you want to focus your time and energy on this sort of Uber competent people that can get a lot of things done. But you need to build a functional organization that has a lot of different people and a lot of different roles. And you can't do that by saying, well, we're just going to focus on these two or three superstars and hope everything else works out. You have to understand how the entire organization functions up and down the hierarchy. And I would say that the chaos to me, if things are going wrong and in some element of the organization, it's the sort of hyper-manager of conscientiousness types that you're describing. They want to just get rid of the chaos. They don't want any change. They don't want anything to sort of disturb the organization. And I don't think that's actually exactly right. I think there's more subtlety to it. I think that when, you know, and sort of the sign of chaos to me is that the idea proliferation just kind of starts to go crazy. You get all these, well, maybe we should do this. They're competing ideas. That's a sign of, I think, in the business context, a sign of one of two different things. Either you have not communicated the goal clearly as a leader or you don't have the right goal and people aren't sure what to do. And so they're actually doing the right thing in the sense that if you don't know what to do and what you are doing isn't working, changing is a good idea. Now, that doesn't mean that you necessarily are changing in the right direction because you may or may not have access to or be privy to what is going on in other aspects of the organization. But to me, it's a sign. It's a smoke signal of something that you need to pay attention to. And the other thing that I typically I see that the causes chaotic behavior is people have a goal. The goal is relatively clear and they realize they're not going to be able to make the goal. And so there's sort of a fear or threat aspect that's starting to occur. And they feel like whatever it is that they're doing isn't working. And they need to make a change in order to make sure that they're successful. So both in a sense, both of those reactions are correct that you need to understand what it is that's motivating the person to sort of change direction so that you can either help them get to the goal or make sure that the goal is clear. And it's not necessarily just that there's a misalignment of confidence, I think, would you? Which was your description? I mean, it could be. Well, I guess I'm also wondering it may be the case as well. It's complicated when it comes to intelligence because intelligent people tend to perform better wherever they're put if it's complex. But you could imagine a situation where there's a lot of different sub-games in your corporate environment. And they're all necessary. So maybe there's a distinction, let's say, between sales and research. So that's a good distinction. The great people on the sales side aren't going to be the same people who are the great people on the research side. Absolutely. So there's going to be a distribution of confidence by specialized bin. I mean, one of the things we know psychologically about specialized bins, let's say, for example, because you might ask yourself, well, how do you conceptualize the different? What does it mean for an occupation to be different from another occupation? Right? Because obviously, nursing doctors are similar, but probably, you know, doctor and graphic artists aren't that similar. And so it begs the question of what constitutes similarity and interest seems to be relevant now, regard, right? We're experiencing a lot of global instability as we plunge into primary season. How are you protecting your family in the midst of all this chaos? The fact is, there is one asset that has was stood famine, moors, and political and economic upheaval dating back to biblical times.

Yeah, you know, I think that gold is to run any organization, but well, I'll focus on a pharmaceutical company. If you want to run it well, you absolutely need to understand people. And I think that one of the things that you've been tremendously helpful to me with is things like the Big Five Personality Profile, and I understand myself. And I think if you can understand what it is that you're good at and what it is that you are not good at, and there's a key component to that, which I would describe as epistemic humility. You have to know the boundary of what you know and what you don't know. And if you can fill in the gap, or if you can understand that and fill in the gap properly, then the organization will function better because you're sort of aligning different skill sets appropriately with what needs to be done. So I think, and another key component to this, I would say I've learned from listening to you, is that because different people perceive the world differently. You have to understand at least somewhat, you have to have some concept of what their reference for. Because if you're a highly ordered conscientious person, then someone who's a creative marketing person, it's almost a different language in terms of how those people view the world. And so you need to sort of, you need to align the way that you communicate with the recipient of the communication, because I mean, it literally is almost like a different language. Right, right. Well, and you know, we hear a lot of squawking about diversity in the culture words that are raging, but there is relevant appreciation for diversity. And real true diversity is actually diversity of temperament, because we know there are five temperaments, dimensions of temperament. We know they're normally distributed, and we know that there are different skills associated with them and that those differences are real. So we know, for example, if you're extroverted, rather than introverted, you're going to be motivated by social interaction. And it's going to energize you rather than innovating you. And it's highly probable, especially if you're involved in sales. This isn't invariably the case, but it's highly likely that like sales, especially sales that involve a lot of presentations, a meeting a lot of people, a lot of group presentations that's much more suitable for someone who's extroverted. Now extroverts can also be impulsive. And and in extreme, in the extreme, you know, there's pathologies associated with every skill, they can also, you know, that can degenerate into mania. You don't get anything without a cost, but it is extremely useful to know that people are actually different, you know, the people who are higher neuroticism, they're going to be much more sensitive to threat. And so you can imagine that that would be one of the things that would stop them from taking risks. And that might be a very bad thing on the strictly entrepreneurial side, but you might imagine too that having a few people around that who serve as canaries in the coal mine could also be extremely useful. And agreeableness is particularly interesting in that regard, because there are really pronounced advantages and disadvantages at the ends of the distribution. So disagreeable people, they're, they're much more likely to bargain hard for themselves. So they're going to be formidable competitors. And they're going to be super blunt. And they can be blunt enough to, to, to be offensive, especially if you're agreeable and neurotic. But they'll tell you exactly what the hell's going on. And if you need a foil for yourself and also someone who if allied with you can help you stop you from being taken advantage of. They're unbelievably useful. Whereas agreeable people, they can be taken advantage of but they're very good at facilitating social bonds between people and making the environment have that feeling of what what closeness and intimacy. Now that's not always appropriate, but sometimes it's unbelievably useful. Right. And so yeah. People will tell you what they really think.

Which interpretation is accurate? Or is there another interpretation altogether? The only way to find out is to decode who or what is behind the creation of the Guide Stones themselves. No question, whoever built the Georgia Guide Stones What Is Climate Change?
Yes Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
Thanks for writing us. This Video is about both side of the issues... So see the note below thanks... We did not sell out anything. We think right now... We are in a ice age time today. The Mercator's map from 1595 showing the Arctic continent with city or town and farming too. Hyperborea was usually described as and was a fabulous realm of eternal spring located in the far north beyond the home of the north wind. Its people were a blessed, long-lived race untouched by war, hard toil and the ravages of old age and disease.
Hyperborea main river was the Eridanos whose banks were lined with amber-weeping poplar-trees and its waters home to flocks of white swans. Blessed with eternal spring, the land producing two crops of grain per year, but most of the countryside was wild and covered with beautiful forests--the so-called ""garden of Apollon.""
Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.
Humans are responsible for global warmingClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.
The average temperature of the Earth’s surface is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.
Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.
The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
People are experiencing climate change in diverse waysClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of “climate refugees” is expected to rise.
Future pandemics will continue to be a threat, so it is important to lay bare the true cause of this devastation. From the beginning, the origins of the pandemic have been debated, even though a natural zoonotic transfer to humans has been determined as the likely cause; however, speculation around a viral bioweapon and laboratory leaks remains. The evidence for the origins of this current pandemic can be found in the science and history behind biological outbreaks and the signs of bioweapon use. This knowledge will help minimize the harm of future pandemics.
One microbe has just devastated our world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, has shattered economies, upended patterns of life globally, and already killed >18.6 million people. More than 886 million cases were documented worldwide so far. Drop in U.S. birth rates amid Covid-19 could have lasting economic impact today.
Genocide Black Abortions in America Abortion kills 1,000 black babies every day in America. Abortion is not just a woman’s issue. It’s a human rights issue. Abortion is the number one killer of black lives in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, abortion kills more black people than HIV, homicide, diabetes, accident, cancer, and heart disease … combined.
In 2019, black women had 38.4% of all abortions in the U.S., despite African-Americans comprising only 13.4% of the total population.
Every increase in global warming mattersIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others.The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.
We face a huge challenge but already know many solutionsMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.
Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: over two-thirds of today’s proven reserves of fossil fuels need to be kept in the ground by 2050 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.
Adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.
We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the futureClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.
Despite the scientific evidence that climate change is a hoax or is not a hoax, there are many non-believers and skeptics in politics, industry, and the general population. Many climate change scientists believe that current climate models do not accurately portray the atmosphere-ocean system, and measurements made by means of satellites show no global warming but a cooling of 0.13°C between 1979 and 1994. The theory of global warming assumes maximum warming at the poles, so why have average temperatures in the Arctic dropped by 0.88°C over the past 50 years? The human-induced climate change hoax is a trojan horse through which unelected globalist bodies such as the United Nations are attempting to seize totalitarian control over every minute detail of our lives under the pretext of “saving the planet”. A report from the United Nations on climate change is based on faulty hypotheses and qualitative conclusions, not the facts about the Earth's temperature or the impact of man-made pollution on the climate. Some Americans are skeptical of whether climate change is happening at all, with the two most skeptical interviewees saying that climate change is a hoax used only for political gains.
The Vikings first colonized Greenland in A.D. 985 and made a living primarily as dairy farmers for more than 400 years before abandoning the settlements. Viking Age Greenlandic society was anchored in the many farms that dotted the settlements, with Christianity visibly present in the churches accompanying them. These farms directly exported precious goods such as skins, hides, and walrus ivory abroad while importing luxuries as well as the necessary iron. The economy of the Norse Greenlanders depended on a combination of pastoral farming with hunting and some fishing. Farmers kept cattle, sheep, and goats - shipped into the island - for their milk, cheese, and butter, while most of the consumed meat came from hunted caribou and seals. Archaeologists now suspect that the Vikings first traveled to Greenland not in search of new land to farm but to acquire walrus-tusk ivory, one of medieval Europe’s most valuable trade items.
When climate scientists talk about natural climate swings that came before humans started messing with the system, many invoke two epochs. During the Medieval Warm Period, roughly from 800 to 1200 AD, temperatures rose a few degrees above average. That warming has been connected to improved crop yields in parts of Europe, and the temporary Viking occupation of Greenland. During the following Little Ice Age, which lasted roughly from 1300 to 1850, the Greenland Vikings disappeared, glaciers from California to the European Alps advanced, and New York harbor froze, enabling people to walk from Manhattan to New Jersey without benefit of the George Washington Bridge.
For a long time, many took on faith the idea that these phenomena were global. But that assumption has been undermined in the past decade or so by studies from widespread areas (including parts of Greenland) suggesting that in fact temperatures in many places did not line up with one or the other periods. Some regions appear to have been warming when they were supposed to be cooling, and vice versa. The same goes for two lesser-known, more vaguely defined earlier swings, known as the Roman Warm Period (ca. 100-300 AD) and the Dark Ages Cold Period (ca.400-800).
A new study puts together the evidence on a global scale for the first time. Based on this, the authors say that the supposed warm and cold epochs may represent, more than anything, regional variations that can be explained by random variability. Published in the leading journal Nature this week, the study analyzes paleoclimate data from across the world, using multiple statistical methods and many sources: tree rings, glacial ice cores, corals, lake sediments. It does not suggest that the periods of high or low temperatures observed during the named epochs did not exist in certain places; rather that they did not exist everywhere at the same time, and thus probably were not caused by some kind of planetary driver.
That said, the study does find one very coherent period: an unprecedented warm one extending over 98 percent of the globe, starting in the 20th century. This is almost certainly caused by us.
We spoke with coauthor Nathan Steiger of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory about climates of the past and present, and what we can learn from them.
What are the most important conclusions of your study?
We show that previously named climate epochs of the Common Era were not coherent phenomena across the globe. This goes against the widespread notion that periods like the Little Ice Age or Medieval Warm Period were global periods of cold or warmth. We’re not the first to point out that there are problems with this idea, but our study is the first to rigorously test the hypothesis on a global scale. In contrast to this, we see that current global warming is remarkably coherent.
How do you tell what temperatures were doing in various parts of the world during these past times?
We rely on proxies. Trees, for example, can be very sensitive to annual changes in temperature and moisture, and the width and density of their annual rings reflect those year-to-year changes. We can then sample hundreds of trees all over the world along with other natural archives to infer what climate was like in the past. For this study in particular we used several different statistical methods that combine all of these proxies to produce global maps of temperature change going back 2,000 years.
Have scientists been too narrow-minded in their geographical focus? I mean, the very name “Medieval” calls up part of European history–a period that didn’t exist in Asia, the Americas or Africa.
Paleoclimate is like many fields of study. There are historical biases in where data is collected, and how the stories about the data are developed. The first paleoclimate data were largely collected from Europe by Europeans, and so it’s not terribly surprising that the stories that try to make sense of such data are Euro-focused. Another problem is that until recently, people have been reluctant to share data and to create narratives that include more than a single, or perhaps a few, time series. If you’re a scientist who has spent a lot of time and money in producing a particular proxy time series, then there’s a tendency to emphasize the importance of that particular time series and to develop a story explaining it. The simplest story to develop is one that corresponds to a traditional understanding of what the climate “should” be doing going back in time. It’s only been in the past few years that scientists from across the paleoclimate community have begun to publicly collate a wide range of data types from all over the globe.
Are you recommending that scientists stop using terms like the “Little Ice Age”?
Not necessarily. In general, having simplified conceptual models of natural phenomena can be very useful and even essential in the pursuit of scientific understanding. It’s when the conceptual models get in the way of accurate science that problems arise. For example, when one labels any Common Era proxy time series with terms like the “Medieval Climate Anomaly,” they are usually implicitly assuming that such epochs were global, and over well-defined time intervals. Our results show that both of these assumptions are incorrect.
Not that there isn’t already plenty of evidence, but does this study add to the argument that humans are causing global warming?
We show that conditions during medieval times or during the Little Ice Age are expected to occur naturally. But the large spatial consistency of the present warm phase cannot be explained by natural variability. This result corroborates many existing studies that have shown that humans are causing global temperatures to rise since the beginning of the industrial period.
Are there limitations to your study?
Yes. Paleoclimate proxies can be used to infer past temperatures, but are not thermometers per se, and so they include non-temperature “noise.” We have therefore tried to use as many proxies as feasible for our study, but we are limited by where the data exists and the quality of the data. Uncertainties are usually largest in places without good quality proxy data. But for the particular hypothesis we’re testing, we don’t think these uncertainties significantly impact the results. We find the same results regardless of which proxy networks or which statistical methodologies we use. So we’re pretty confident in the results.
Georgia Guide Stones America’s Stonehenge Are they a monument to human civilization, or a powerful condemnation of our species? And who the heck built them?
What if I told you that America has its own Stonehenge?
These giant stones were set up on a hillside outside, of all places, Atlanta in 1980. The man who had them built remains unknown, as does the monument’s true purpose. In fact, other than their half-million-dollar price tag, almost nothing is known about the stones at all. They’re composed of 119 tons of solid granite and have coded messages that are engraved into them in the world’s eight most commonly spoken languages.
These rectangular pillars are also precisely crafted to track astrological and solar cycles. There are some who interpret the messages here as a sign of the end of days. Others theorize that they’re a call for genocide on a massive scale. So what’s the message they contain? Who built them? Why are they located on a remote hillside in Georgia? And, of course, what are they intended to guide us toward?
How and why the Guidestones were built have never been answered. But here’s what we do know: The monument didn’t just appear out of nowhere.
On a summer day in 1979, a man using the alias R. C. Christian shows up at the Elberton Granite Finishing Company, presents very detailed and specific plans, and tells them he wants to build the Georgia Guidestones. The only details we have about the man is that he was balding, with a fringe of white hair, and had an accent that suggested he was from one of the Plains states. Also, he had money—a lot of money. And the only thing he absolutely demanded was that he remain completely anonymous. To this day, no one has been able to figure out who he is.
What Christian commissioned, though, was no small undertaking. In fact, even with as deep a history of working with granite as Elberton had, they’d never encountered anything like the request from “R. C. Christian.”
In fact, even if there was nothing more to the Georgia Guidestones than the stones themselves, the monument would be exceptionally impressive—a testament to the skills and abilities of the granite company R. C. Christian hired.
But there is more to the Guidestones than the granite slabs. Much more. Some say it’s mysterious, others say it’s sinister.
The stones were unveiled during a public ceremony in 1980. They were controversial immediately. Supporters like Yoko Ono praised their message as a stirring call to rational thinking. But opponents attacked them, calling them the Ten Commandments of the Antichrist.
So what’re the messages on the stones? First, you need to know that each message appears in English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian—the eight most widely spoken languages on Earth—which means the ten lines on each slab are intended for all of the world’s inhabitants.
But as for the messages themselves, the first nine, reading up from the bottom, seem to be a benign call to higher thinking: Don’t be a cancer on the earth; seek harmony; balance personal rights with social duties; avoid petty laws; resolve international conflicts in a world court; protect people with fair laws; rule with reason; unite humanity with a new language; and guide reproduction wisely. But it’s the topmost directive on the stones that stops everyone cold:
Maintain Humanity Under 500 Million In Perpetual Balance With Nature.
Here is what is written on the Georgia Guidestones:
1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
2. Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.
3. Unite humanity with a living new language.
4. Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.
5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
8. Balance personal rights with social duties.
9. Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.
10. Be not a cancer on the earth — Leave room for nature — Leave room for nature.
A human population under 500 million would certainly be more “in balance” with nature.
But To achieve a population under 500 million would mean that more than 7 billion of us would have to die. Or be killed.
Exactly. The directive makes some believe that the Guidestones are calling for the mass murder of billions of innocent people—a global genocide that would kill the vast majority of the human race.
Which interpretation is accurate? Or is there another interpretation altogether?
The only way to find out is to decode who—or what—is behind the creation of the Guidestones themselves.
No question, whoever built the Georgia Guidestones, they were determined to protect their anonymity. So to find out more about the mysterious R. C. Christian, we began by talking to Guidestone historian Raymond Wiley, coauthor of The Georgia Guidestones: America’s Most Mysterious Monument. According to Wiley, the pseudonym R. C. Christian is a clue itself—a fairly blatant one—that hearkens back to a 15-century physician and mystic named Christian Rosenkreutz, the idea of the Rose Cross, and the secretive organization known as the Rosicrucians.
Christian Rosenkreutz is said to have founded the secretive Rosicrucian Society in Germany in the early 15th century, but some dispute that the man even lived at all. Some people say he’s not even real. Others say he’s more than one person.
For the members of the society, Rosenkreutz was a doctor who had spent a lifetime gathering what he called sacred knowledge. Studying ancient Turkish, Sufi, and Persian paths toward understanding, as well as Western medical knowledge, he supposedly traveled through the Middle East, being instructed by masters of ancient wisdom.
When he returned, Rosenkreutz supposedly founded his own church to pass on the learning to make sure that it didn’t die with him. So, at first, all the members were doctors. Each one took an oath to heal the sick without payment, to maintain the secrecy of the fellowship, and to find a replacement for Rosenkreutz before he died.
The sacred knowledge is said to include elements of alchemy and psychic manipulation. Yup. Modern Rosicrucians are believed to have even been able to tap the ultimate power of the human mind. Some think the sect has evolved and they now seek to protect and guide humanity away from its own destruction. Others have accused the Rosicrucians of being out-and-out evil. To be clear, there are offshoots of Rosicrucians everywhere.
Think about this—if you had a vision of an American Stonehenge, a massive granite creation bearing your philosophy for the world, and you possessed the resources to underwrite its creation, would you want to keep your name out of it? For most of us, I think the answer would be “probably not.” Our egos and our vanity might insist that we take at least some of the credit. Yet among the inscriptions on the monument is the announcement that their byline is a pseudonym. Is this humility—or deliberate misdirection?
Human nature and the role vanity plays in it would seem to rule out one name often mentioned as a possible source of funding for the Guidestones: Ted Turner, media mogul and one of America’s largest individual owners of real estate. At one point, Turner argued that the earth would be better served by a far smaller population than our present numbers, a statement that generated much controversy at the time. But while the ideas expressed on the stones, if interpreted benignly, do reflect Turner’s well-known global harmony and environmental concerns, modesty, humility, and anonymity are not qualities often—or maybe ever— associated with the man once widely referred to as the “Mouth of the South.”
So if the man behind the Georgia Guidestones wasn’t Turner or, probably, any other high-profile, well-heeled philanthropist or visionary, who was he?
Only a few people ever met him. One was attorney Wyatt Martin, who handled the legal matters related to the Guidestones, and who signed a vow never to discuss his client, a vow he has kept.
Another was Hudson Cone, who was present at the granite company when the Guidestones were being created. Cone remembers Christian as a tall, balding man, with a fringe of white hair. He was well spoken and comported himself well. He gave no indication of who—or what—he represented.
That ambiguity, Cone believes to this day, was deliberate.
“Any time you have something with an air of mystery around it,” he said, “you invite different interpretations.”
Those differing interpretations, Cone insists, are one of the things that have kept the Georgia Guidestones at the center of so much speculation and public interest. He has had people tell him that the site is the holiest spot, while others argue that it’s a profane location, a focal point for satanic power and ultimate evil.
Cone doesn’t believe that the spot or the Guidestones are evil. In fact, he thinks that the questions the Guidestones raise are themselves its truest purpose.
“I believe it was put here to stimulate curiosity,” Cone said.
That, too, makes a lot of sense to me. What better way to get people talking—and thinking —about the nature of our relationship to the world and to one another—than by creating an enormous mystery . . . and presenting that mystery in the world’s great languages so that all can participate in the discussion?
One question that has remained throughout our investigation of the Georgia Guidestones—why Georgia? Why were the stones placed on their particular site?
Turns out there’s a serious—and mysterious—reason for that as well.
The theory of Earth Changes, first propounded by the mystic Edgar Cayce early in the 20th century, argues that we are rapidly approaching a time of devastating changes to the surface of the earth. Those changes could be the result of earthquakes, asteroid or comet impact, super volcanoes, solar flares—whatever. As we’ve seen, particularly in terms of the 2012 believers—but also as with previous apocalypse believers such as those who feared the end of the world would accompany the new millennium, or those who saw global devastation coming as Halley’s Comet returned, or any of the hundreds of other doomsday faiths that have come and gone—the specific details of the actual apocalypse vary from believer to believer, and some of them have already been proven inaccurate.
What matters for the purposes of decoding the Guidestones is the consequences of the devastation.
And those consequences include a radically altered surface of the earth—a surface that will lack many of the most familiar features of the world we know.
What sort of features?
Minor things like: California, New York City, parts of Florida, and other landmasses throughout the world.
That’s scary.
But according to Cayce’s Earth Changes theory, it turns out that in addition to the changes that would alter the physical face of the world, there are “safe zones” that would ride out the earth changes, and in doing so provide a psychic focus for the energies needed to rebuild the world.
Where are those safe zones?
You guessed it—one of them is in rural Georgia. (See Exhibit 8B, page 56, for a map.)
It’s where the Guidestones stand, meaning they’re ready to help the survivors of the earth changes rebuild the world. And rebuild it better.
I believe that the Georgia Guidestones are, on one level, exactly what they appear to be—a tool for getting people to think about the nature of existence, and the ways in which that existence could be improved.
I think that there’s a good chance that the person behind them was a Rosicrucian.
But I also think that there’s a motivation for the stones that may have been overlooked, and that the motivation lies in the times during which they were commissioned and created.
The Georgia Guidestones came into being in the late 1970s and early 1980s—a time of enormous international tension between the United States and the then-existing Soviet Union. At the heart of those tensions: tens of thousands of nuclear warheads, an arsenal of destruction aimed at each other’s throats and more than capable of bringing civilization down in a mass of radioactive rubble.
They were among the scariest times in human history—and a reminder that we don’t need an apocalypse beyond our control to end the world. For more than half a century, we have held the power to do it ourselves. Self-inflicted genocide by nuclear bombs controlled by our governments: No secret cabals need apply.
And I think that it was the possibility of just such a nuclear holocaust that prompted R. C. Christian to create the message he placed on the Georgia Guidestones. A message intended for the survivors of a global nuclear holocaust. A message designed to help them restore a balance to the earth—and to avoid the mistakes that destroyed their ancestors.
That, I think, is the purpose of the Georgia Guidestones, and that’s the message we decoded during our investigation.
Of course, there’s one person, if he’s still alive, who knows whether or not my interpretation is accurate, and that’s R. C. Christian, but he’s not talking.
I just hope that he does come forth, and tell us whether or not any of our interpretations of the Georgia Guidestones are accurate. Or if there is another interpretation—perhaps brighter, perhaps darker—that we may have overlooked.
Until then, we have the Georgia Guidestones themselves, speaking their message to the ages—and to each of us in their own way.

75 Facts About the Earth1. Earth is not a perfect sphere.Yes, we've all been taught that the Earth is not flat, but it may shock you to learn that it's not perfectly spherical either. As the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) points out, Earth spins while gravity pushes toward the center and a centrifugal force, perpendicular to Earth's axis, pushes out. This results in a bit of a tilted shape—not a perfect sphere.

The Vine City Walmart Supercenter closed its doors after an alleged arson in December — the second fire that year. Another Atlanta-based Walmart on Howell Mill Road was also shut down following a fire. Walmart has been struggling to combat rampant retail theft, CEO Doug McMillon told CNBC in 2022. ""Theft is an issue. It's higher than what it has historically been. We've got safety measures, security measures that we've put in place by store location,"" McMillon said. ""I think local law enforcement being staffed and being a good partner is part of that equation, and that's normally how we approach it. If that's not corrected over time, prices will be higher, and/or stores will close."" In 2023, the retail corporation closed 22 stores across 15 states and Washington, D.C., the U.S. Sun reported. Four of the shuttered stores were located in Chicago. Walmart stated that the Chicago-based locations were losing ""tens of millions of dollars a year, and their annual losses nearly doubled in just the last five years."" ""We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the city. ... It was hoped that these investments would help improve our stores' performance. Unfortunately, these efforts have not materially improved the fundamental business challenges our stores are facing,"" the company added. In August, Walmart announced that it would reopen Atlanta's Vine City location as a Neighborhood Market, typically smaller than the retailer's Supercenter stores. Mayor Andre Dickens argued that the community would become a food desert without the grocery retailer, Rough Draft Atlanta reported. ""Food insecurity is real across Georgia,"" Dickens stated. ""And we don't want it to happen here in Atlanta. Eight years ago, about 54% of the people in the city lived within a half-mile of fresh food. Now we're up to 75%."" ""This administration wants to make sure we have healthy communities, which means adding grocery stores,"" he added. As part of the reopening, the Walmart location will be the first to include a police substation. According to Dickens, the station will not be staffed at all hours but will serve as a location for law enforcement to fill out paperwork, have meetings, and charge body cameras and cell phones. Dickens believes the increased police presence will deter shoplifting and other crimes. Like Blaze News?

As one of the 11 selected Fellows representing Sierra Leone, Rugiatu joins a cohort of 700 young leaders from across Africa to engage in leadership development activities at various prestigious U.S. educational institutions. Through her business, Slay Farms, Rugiatu is nurturing not just crops but also a community of women farmers. On her 10-acre farm, she shares her extensive knowledge of sustainable agricultural practices with other women, fostering a network of empowered individuals with a common goal. The farm serves as a hub for learning events, where women gather to exchange expertise and stay updated on the latest advancements in sustainable farming techniques. Moreover, Slay Farms acts as a link, connecting these farmers with wider markets for their produce, thus ensuring economic growth for the entire community. During her time as a Mandela Washington Fellow, Rugiatu Favour Kanu had the opportunity to visit the Metro Atlanta Urban Farm in the USA. There, she encountered Bobby Wilson, an enthusiastic urban farmer whose dedication to providing food for those in need has earned him recognition as one of CNN's top ten heroes in the family category. Rugiatu was inspired by the farm's emphasis on giving back to the community and the crucial role urban agriculture plays in sustainable food production. As part of her commitment to volunteerism and giving back, Rugiatu and her fellow Fellows joined forces at the Atlanta Community Food Bank. They passionately packed food and assembled health kits, driven by the desire to make a positive impact on the lives of those less fortunate. In this act of selflessness, the Fellows found unity despite their diverse backgrounds and experiences, resonating with the transformative power of community service. Rugiatu Favour Kanu's work exemplifies the spirit of the Mandela Washington Fellowship and the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), representing the United States' dedication to investing in the future of Africa. Through sustainable farming and empowering women, Rugiatu is leaving a lasting impact on her community, bridging gaps and fostering a brighter, more equitable future for Sierra Leone and beyond.

This week, the Atlanta Journal & Constitution reported that Georgia will once again have a $5 Billion surplus. A spokesperson for Governor Kemp was quoted as saying the governor, “Looks forward to working closely with the General Assembly on priorities for how the state’s one-time funds will be utilized in a strategic, fiscally responsible way that does not commit short-term revenue gains to long-term obligations.” 

But surplus, by definition, is an amount that remains when a use or need is satisfied. 

The use of the term when applied to our state’s budget and needs is incorrect. 

Our government doesn't exist for the purpose of generating a profit—it's not a business. 

Government exists to serve the public sector. Taxes are collected to maintain shared infrastructure. 

There isn’t a budget surplus in Georgia when we have public services not rendered and many unmet basic human needs in healthcare, education, jobs, housing, food, disability waivers, and mental health services. 

Many positive legislative programs to meet these needs received bipartisan support last session but many were slashed by the Governor.

These so-called “surplus” funds should be invested in the long term commitment to create opportunities for Georgians.  This would be the fiscally responsible approach for the well being of all Georgians.

When anger is misdirected, it's focused on the wrong person or source. Believe it or not, instances of displaced anger occur more often than most people realize. Situations and things are not always what they appear to be, and, sometimes, it can be challenging to see beyond the smoke and mirrors. This is why it's so important to be aware of the situation and cognizant of the factors involved when you're feeling angry.
Georgia Guidestones Inscriptions - A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Traditional Chinese, and Russian.1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.2. Guide reproduction wisely—improving fitness and diversity.3. Unite humanity with a living new language.4. Rule passion—faith—tradition—and all things with tempered reason.5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.8. Balance personal rights with social duties.9. Prize truth—beauty—love—seeking harmony with the infinite.10. Be not a cancer on the Earth—Leave room for nature—Leave room for nature.
What’s the Difference Between Equity and Equality?Even if you take the time to search the words equity and equality in the dictionary, you might walk away thinking they mean the same thing. Merriam-Webster defines equitable as “dealing fairly and equally with all concerned,” and equal as “of the same measure, quantity, amount, or number as another.” However, much like systemic and systematic, the two words (and their derivatives) can’t be used interchangeably.Equality has to do with giving everyone the exact same resources.Equity involves distributing resources based on the needs of the recipients.On the left side of the illustration above, for example, three identical boxes are given to three people of different heights—it’s an equal distribution of resources, but it fails to consider that the tallest person doesn’t need a box to see over the fence, while the shortest person could clearly use an extra one. When the boxes are redistributed equitably, as seen on the right side of the illustration, all three spectators can watch the game.As George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health explains, recognizing the difference between equality and equity is important in just about every sphere of life: public health, politics, education, racial justice, and more. If each public school in a certain county receives 150 new laptops, that’s technically equal. But it doesn’t factor in that some of those schools might be located in high-income districts where most of the students already have their own laptops. Instead, officials should allocate the devices according to which schools have the greatest need for them—that way, they can minimize the chance that dozens of laptops will end up gathering dust at one school, while another doesn't have enough to go around.To summarize, equality is about dividing resources in matching amounts, and equity focuses more on dividing resources proportionally to achieve a fair outcome for those involved.
Never stay in a place where no one see your value.A father said to his daughter “You have graduated with honors, here is a car I bought many years ago.It is a bit older now but before I give it to you, take it to the used car lot downtown and tell them you want to sell it and see how much they offer you for it.The daughter went to the used car lot, returned to her father and said, “They offered me $1,000 because they said it looks pretty worn out.”The father said, now “Take it to the pawn shop.” The daughter went to the pawn shop, returned to her father and said,”The pawn shop offered only $100 because it is an old car.”The father asked his daughter to go to a car club now and show them the car. The daughter then took the car to the club, returned and told her father,” Some people in the club offered $100,000 for it because it’s a Rare Lina RXT 1980 Only One Made and it's an iconic car and sought by many collectors”Now the father said this to his daughter, “The right place values you the right way,” If you are not valued, do not be angry, it means you are in the wrong place. Those who know your value are those who appreciate you. Never stay in a place where no one sees your value.
The Georgia Guidestones are a granite monument erected in 1980 in Elbert County, Georgia, in the United States. A set of ten guidelines is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient language scripts.
The monument stands at an approximate elevation of 750 feet (230 m) above sea level, about 90 miles (140 km) east of Atlanta, 45 miles (72 km) from Athens, Georgia.

Like Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), Secret Cold War experiments tested various drugs during unethical human experimentation in the United States. These hallucinogenic drugs (See also psychosomatic medicine) antagonize psychological phenomena, which may explain (but not conclusively) seeing ""aliens"" during abductions.3-hydroxy-1-methyl-5,6-in doline-dione Adrenochrome is an oxidation product of adrenaline (ephinephrine, norepinephrine). The effects and classification of this drug is said to be controversial because it is debated whether is has any psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects, although some test subjects compared the adrenochrome experience to mild psilocybin and LSD experiences.We decode the Monsters Inc, Coma and Dragnet films, examining the foundations of adrenochrome science and how it relates MK Ultra Media Programming and the pineal gland. Adrenochrome is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C9H9NO3 produced by the oxidation of adrenaline.

This is O.K. but I Think its Wrong about Stopping Social Security's Trust Fund Back by Gold ? Is fully solvent until 2033 ? and is sourced from FICA, SECA, Income Tax and interest.Social Security trust funds are financial accounts in the U.S. Treasury. There are two separate Social Security trust funds, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund pays retirement and survivors benefits, and the Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund pays disability benefits.
Social Security Is Gone and Remember, not only did you and I contribute to Social Security, but your employer did, too. It totals 15% of your income before taxes. If you averaged only $30K over your working life, that's close to $220,500. Read that again!
Did you see where the Government paid in one single penny?We are talking about the money you and your employer put in a Government bank to insure you and I that we would have a retirement check from the money we put in, not the Government. Now they are calling the money we put in an ENTITLEMENT when we reach the age to take it back.
If you calculate the future invested value of $4,500 per year (yours & your employer's contribution) at a simple 5% interest (less than what the Government pays on the money that it borrows), after 49 years of working you'd have $892,919.98.
If you took out only 3% per year, you'd receive $26,787.60 per year and it would last better than 30 years (until you're 95 if you retire at age 65) and that's with no interest paid on that final amount on deposit! If you bought an annuity and it paid 4% per year, you'd have a lifetime income of $2,976.40 per month.
If you have a deceased spouses who died in their 50's -- their S.S. money will never have one cent drawn from what they paid into S.S. all their lives over the past 30 years!
Entitlement my foot, I paid cash for my social security insurance! Just because they borrowed the money for other government spending, doesn't make my benefits some kind of charity or handout!! Remember Congressional benefits? --- free healthcare, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days.
Now that's welfare!!! And they have the nerve to call my social security retirement payments entitlements?!?
They call Social Security and Medicare an entitlement even though most of us have been paying for it all our working lives, and now, when it's time for us to collect, the government is running out of money.
Why did the government borrow from it in the first place? It was supposed to be in a locked box back by gold, not part of the general fund.
Something to ponder:History Lesson on Your Social Security CardJust in case some of you young whippersnappers (and some older ones) didn't know this. It's easy to check out, if you don't believe it. Be sure and show it to your familyand friends. They need a little history lesson on what's what and it doesn't matter whether you are Democrat or Republican. Facts are Facts.Social Security Cards up until the 1980s expressly stated the number and Card were not to be used for identification purposes. Since nearly everyone in the United States now has a number, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message, NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION was removed.An old Social Security card with the ""NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION"" message.Our Social Security Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program. He promised:1) That participation in the Program would be completely voluntary, No longer Voluntary2) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, Now 7.65% On the first $90,000.3) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, No longer tax deductible4) That the money the participants put in went to the Independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the General Operating Fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program, and, Under Johnson the money was moved to The General Fund and spent.5) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. Under Clinton & Gore up to 85% of your Social Security can be taxed. Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to 'put away -- you may be interested in the following:------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the Independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the General Fund so that Congress could spend it?A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the Democratically controlled House and Senate.------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding?A: The Democratic Party.------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -----Q: Which Political Party started taxing SocialSecurity annuities?A: The Democratic Party with Al Gore casting the 'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the U.S.------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -Q: Which Political Party decided to startgiving annuity payments to immigrants?(AND MY FAVORITE):A: That's right!Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party.Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive Social Security payments! The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it!------------ -- ------------ --------- ----- ------------ --------- ---------Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away! And the worst part about it is uninformed citizens believe it! If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe changes will evolve. But it's worth a try. How many people can YOU send this to? Actions speak louder than bumper stickers.
32 Shocking Sexual Assault Statistics for 2023 At present, sexual assaults are the most prevalent crimes in the US, yet also the most underreported.
Over the last two decades, much work has been dedicated to change the landscape of sexual assault and to empower victims of this type of crime.
But the thing is:
Despite several helpful, progressive reforms, sexual assault statistics reflect that many crimes are still not fully addressed or understood.
Which is why:
It is important that we analyze and address the strengths and weaknesses of the current approach with the help of the latest sexual harassment statistics in order to understand what needs improving and where.
With that said, let’s dive right in.
Alarming Sexual Violence Statistics (Editor’s Choice)One of the most shocking facts about sexual assault is that approximately only 5% of sexual assault reports filed have been proven false.82% of all juvenile sexual assault victims are female.90% of adult rape victims are female.41% of sexual assaults against Native Indians are committed by a stranger.Adolescents aged 14‐17 were by far the most likely to be sexually victimized; nearly one in six (16.3%) was sexually victimized in the past year.General Statistics about Sexual AssaultAlthough statistics on sexual assault can’t even begin to convey the suffering of victims and their families, they can offer a glimpse into the disturbing extent of the issue.
1. In 2019, over 652,676 women were raped.This figure excludes non-rape sexual assaults but includes date rape statistics; if included, data from non-rape sexual assaults would take the figure closer to the one million mark. What’s worse, it has been rising for the last decade at an annual rate of 2.9%, and this trend shows no sign of decreasing.
2. Over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence.Sexual abuse, as shown by rape and sexual assault statistics, has affected 41.8% of women in the US who have been victimized by sexual violence other than rape.
3. Nearly 80% of female sexual assault victims experience their first assault before the age of 25.Exactly 79.6% of female victims who have experienced one or more completed rape did so before the age of 25.
4. Around 20% of American males have been the victim of sexual violence.According to Rainn statistics, outside of the correctional system, most rape victims are female. However, studies show that 21.4% of males in the US have been the victims of sexual violence and have experienced this outside of any prison facility.
5. A quarter of male victims of sexual assault were under 10 years of age.According to studies, an estimated total of 28% of male victims of sexual assault in the US will have experienced their first assault at 10 years of age or younger.
6. Rape Statistics show that less than 20% of rapes are reported.It is estimated that only 19% of rapes, completed or attempted, are reported annually. This figure runs consistently across the board. The general consensus is that rape is still considered something shameful, hence victim reluctance.
7. Women and men with disabilities face twice the risk of sexual assault than able-bodied individuals.Sadly, data gathered from watchdog organizations and US sexual assault statistics have found that disabled people were twice as likely to be victims of sexual assault than able-bodied people. Statistics of sexual abuse show that the majority of these heinous assaults were carried out in care environments (both facilities and home care). Yet, they were also reported as taking place during hospital or general practitioner sessions, as well as in individual therapy sessions.
8. Nearly 20,000 sexual assaults were reported in the military last year.A study on the level of sexual assault within the military from 2010 revealed sexual violence statistics that showed a figure of 3,577, of which only a quarter took place during deployment in combat zones.
The study was repeated in 2019, and the sexual assault stats showed over 19,000 sexual assaults had now taken place in the US military.
9. 7.2% of all children surveyed in 2019 had been victims of sexual assault.Child sexual abuse statistics highlight the harrowing revelation that teens aged 14 to 17 were in the highest risk category for sexual assault, with more than one in four adolescents (27.3%) having been sexually victimized during their lifetimes.
10. Approximately 70 women commit suicide every day in the US following an act of sexual violence.Women sexual assault statistics reveal some extremely disturbing facts. An estimated 70 women commit suicide daily in the US, directly as a result of sexual violence. Worryingly, this figure has grown by 2.87% over the last year.
11. Sexual violence incidents, preceded by stalking, increased by 1.9% in 2019.According to statistics and sexual harassment facts from 2019, the incidents of stalking that led to sexual assaults have increased steadily over the last year. What makes this figure even more alarming is the fact that initiatives were put in place to prevent and protect victims from such occurrences. So, governmental legislation and thinking about the issue must be reviewed.
12. During 2019, 13% of all women in California were victims of rape.Sexual harassment statistics reflect a large percentage of Californian women have been reported as having been a victim to an attempted or completed rape in 2019. Current rape statistics by state show that 13% of all Californian women are in danger of being a victim of sexual assault.
13. Statistics show that 1 in 6 US women will be raped annually in the US.Surveys and rape statistics by gender have found that 1 in 6 American women, and 1 in 33 American men has experienced an attempted/completed rape as a child or adult. This disturbing figure has been predicted to rise exponentially over the next three years.
14. Over 1.5 million women were raped by an intimate partner in 2019.Statistics on sexual harassment from the Department of Justice suggest that over 1.5 million women and 834,700 men are raped and/or physically assaulted annually by an intimate partner in the United States. This staggering figure is both disheartening and unnerving.
Experts have created focus groups to analyze and explore these sexual assault statistics by state in more depth.
Little Known Facts About Male Victims of Sexual ViolenceAccording to sexual assault statistics, males are also high-risk victims of sexual violence.
Which means that:
Sexual abuse is not limited to females, and the abuse of boys has little to do with either the abuser’s or the victim’s sexual orientation.
Perhaps unsurprisingly:
Male rape statistics show that most perpetrators of male sexual assault are men. These predators choose to rape both gay or straight men because rape is an act of aggression and domination, not of sexual desire.
Contrary to popular belief:
Girls and women can most definitely be perpetrators of sexual violence toward males, and instances of this kind are more prevalent in society than most people realize.
In contradiction to the sweeping statement thinking of most people, male sexual assault statistics have now proved that most males who experience sexual assault (at any age) do not automatically go on to become sexual abusers.
In many cases:
According to gun violence statistics, attackers can use various weapons, physical force, or even the threat of force to gain the upper hand. Others, according to rape victim statistics, may use blackmail or their position of authority to threaten someone into submission.
15. Approximately 16% of males in juvenile prisons have been sexually abused.A 2019 study by the US Center for Disease Control examined woman rape statistics in juvenile prisons for incidents and frequency of sexual violence. The results showed that 16% of males had been victims of sexual abuse, whereas over 60% of males in these facilities had encountered the threat of sexual violence.
16. In Florida alone, a staggering total of 1,477,000 men have been victim to sexual assault.In Florida, 20.4% of men, or 1,477,000 men, have been victimized by sexual violence over the last decade.
17. Over 25% of male sexual assault victims will experience their first assault before 10 years of age.According to sexual assault statistics 2019, studies and statistical analysis, in excess of 25% (27.8% to be exact) of male victims of sexual assault will probably experience their first attack by age 10 or younger.
18. Nearly 40% of adult males that experience sexual violence from an intimate partner are left with psychological scarring.Reports and studies on US rape statistics show clearly that 39.7% of men who have experienced sexual assault from their partner such as rape, stalking or physical violence, are left with long term impacts such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other types of psychological injury.
19. New York statistics show that 18% of all rapes in the city involved a male victim.According to rape statistics, extensive studies, and focus groups, 2019 involved a record high of male rape victims within the city, with a record high figure of 18% - which is 5.7% higher than 2018.
Sexual Assault Effects on Society20. Over 80% of sexual assaults are committed by an acquaintance.Relatives, teachers, religious leaders, former spouses - unfortunately, the list of possible attackers is one of people who will most often have a very intimate relationship with the victim. Statistics on rape indicate that this connection normally results in most rape victims shying away from reporting such incidents due to obligatory or emotional pressures.
21. Almost 95% of child victims knew their sexual attacker.Rape stats by RAINN show that the vast majority percentage (93.98%) of child victims in the US in 2019 were familiar with their attacker. In almost all of these cases, as reflected by teenage sexual assault statistics, the child had spent a significant amount of time (10 plus hours, in one full duration or segmented) with their attacker prior to the sexual assault taking place.
22. The rate of false rape claims in the US is well below the 10% average mark.Although false rape claims do happen, it is important to keep in mind that the majority of rape claims are legitimate, as sexual assault statistics reveal.
In fact, data collated in 2019 from false rape statistics, shows that a combined rate of 6.9% of rape claims were false.
23. Sexual assaults cost the US billions of dollars annually.Findings from college sexual assault statistics and other reports show that although sexual assaults take heinous tolls on their victims and cause terrible emotional damage, there is another cost that is rarely factored into such tragic events - the cost on society in financial terms.
According to stats on sexual abuse, when we factor in the costs of funding and running sexual assault services, the resulting lower educational aspirations (a common affliction amongst adolescents who have been the victim of child abuse), and the cost of lost earnings of victims who have been traumatized to a point where they are unable to work, the costs on the US annually are in excess of $450 billion. A staggering figure on paper, and one that has, according to stats on sexual assault, been increasing yearly by 1.8% on average.
24. 69% of rape victims in the US are women aged between 12 to 34 years old.Sexual violence figures from 2019 were significantly higher compared to sexual assault statistics 2018. The 12-34 age bracket has been known to encompass the majority of rape victims in the US on an average year.
25. Transgender college students have a 5% higher rate of getting raped than other students.After conducting studies on sexual assault statistics by gender, US colleges have reported a rise in sexual attacks on transgender students. College rape statistics about transgender, genderqueer, and gender-nonconforming (TGQN) students have shown that in 2019 an average of 23% of students were in danger of being sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN students. These stats are concerning because they are significantly higher than college sexual assault statistics 2018, which means the problem is getting out of control.
26. Bisexual women are more than twice as likely to victims of rape than straight women.Of all the women at the greatest risk from sexual assault in the US, bisexual women are statistically in the danger zone. Sexual abuse statistics show that 46% of bisexual women reported being a victim of sexual assault in 2019, compared to 17% of straight women.
Furthermore, sexual assault on college campuses statistics show an interesting correlation, which reveals that bisexual men face similar issues, with 47% of them being victims of sexual violence, compared to 21% of heterosexual men.
27. The majority (90%) of rape victims are female.Findings from sexual assault reporting statistics have unsurprisingly revealed that women make up the vast majority of rape victims. This figure reflects rape statistics US and includes adult victims but excludes juvenile victims, who, if included, would total 82% of all rape victims.
28. An American is sexually assaulted every 93 seconds.Sexual assaults are on the rise throughout the whole of the US. On average, state by state comparative analysis (including rape statistics by race data) shows that there are approximately 325,566 victims of rape and sexual assault (age 12 or older) in the US every year.
29. People with disabilities are twice as likely to be victims of rape and sexual assault as those without disabilities.Both males and females with disabilities experienced higher rates of victimization than able-bodied males and females. Surprisingly, rape statistics in the US show that those with a type of cognitive-functioning disability were at higher risk of violent victimization than those with any other type of disability.
30. Girls and women between the ages of 16 and 19 are 4x more likely than girls and women in other age groups to be assaulted or raped.Results gathered from numerous studies show that campus sexual assault statistics have found patterns on the locale of victims. In general, 46% of sexual assault victims were sleeping or performing another activity at home when they were victimized.
Nearly 23% were traveling to and from school or work, shopping, or running errands. Some 19% were working when they were assaulted, 9% were attending school, and 19% were doing some other activity.
31. One out of every six American females is a victim of attempted or completed sexual assault.According to sexual assault facts, one out of every six American women will most probably be the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. This ratio has doubled in the last five years, and analysts predict the same to happen over the course of the next half a decade.
1 in 33 American men (about 3% of the total percentage of women sexually assaulted) have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. This figure has increased by 22.4% over the last five years.
32. For every 1000 rapes in the US, 995 perpetrators will go unpunished.Studies covering unreported sexual assault statistics show that the overwhelming majority of perpetrators will escape punishment of any kind.
US rape stats show that too many victims are afraid to follow through with the legalities of their claim, leading to perpetrators escaping punishment of any form.
Sexual Assault Statistics: The Way AheadAs you can see from the latest stats, the current state of sexual assaults in the US is fairly bad, and current measures do not seem to be working.
So, in addition to increasing awareness of sexual assault dangers, the stigma around sexual assaults needs to be lifted. This will encourage victims to come forward and prosecute attackers and also allow authorities to provide victims with the assistance and help they need in order to heal.
Millions of US women say first sexual experience was rape and New study finds one in 16 women says first sexual experience was forced or coerced in early teens. The first sexual experience for one in 16 US women was forced or coerced intercourse in their early teens, encounters that for some may have had lasting health repercussions, a new study suggests.
The experiences amount to rape, the authors say, although they relied on a national survey that didn’t use the word in asking women about forced sex.
Almost seven percent of women surveyed said their first sexual intercourse experience was involuntary; it happened at age 15 on average and the man was often several years older.
Nearly half of those women who said intercourse was involuntary said they were held down and slightly more than half of them said they were verbally pressured to have sex against their will.
“Any sexual encounter (with penetration) that occurs against somebody’s will is rape. If somebody is verbally pressured into having sex, it’s just as much rape,” said lead author Dr Laura Hawks, an internist and Harvard Medical School researcher.
In the years after coerced or forced sex, affected women had more sex partners, unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and more reproductive health problems including pelvic pain and menstrual irregularities than women whose first sexual experience was not forced.
America Is Largest Drug Cartels In The World and Fentanyl Alone or Fentanyl Laced w-Xylazine To Kill Us is a potent synthetic opioid drug approved by and sold by the Food and Drug Administration for use as an analgesic (pain relief) and anesthetic. It is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin as an analgesic. Illicitly manufactured, fentanyl is added to heroin, disguising it as highly potent heroin, so users don’t realize that the heroin they’re purchasing may contain fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that was originally developed as an analgesic – or painkiller – for surgery. It has a specific chemical structure with multiple areas that can be modified, often illicitly, to form related compounds with marked differences in potency. Fentanyl’s chemical backbone (the structure in the center) has multiple areas (the colored circles) that can be substituted with different functional groups (the colored boxes around the edges) to change its potency.America Is Largest Drug Cartels In The World and is currently the majority supplier of drug for profit a so called illicit fentanyl to North America, with most, if not all of the cartel's heroin now also being mixed with fentanyl or related chemical like xylazine analogues to increase the heroin's “potency” in a more cost-effective manner. As of Jan. 2023, the U.S. Government Cartel is overall the most active drug cartel involved in flying in from china etc. and so called smuggling illicit drugs into the United States and trafficking them throughout the country by are own Food and Drug Administration.
Departure of 100 Thousands Private Drug Contractors Was a Turning Point in Afghan Military’s Collapse and often military veterans who work for drug trade and private security firms. 90% opium-heroin in afganistan area left Afghanistan weeks ago and deployed elsewhere in the region or in the Persian Gulf.
The Afghan troops could still do the basics of ground combat without American private contractors, and they’d even added some level of skill in repairing military vehicles.
But it was the U.S.-supplied air power that gave Afghan troops their advantage over Taliban fighters, and without on-the-ground maintenance contractors, the military quickly collapsed.

Now its very funny again the CIA/FBI Our Government is Sell Drugs Again. The U.S. drug epidemic reached another terrible milestone Wednesday when the government announced that more than 100,000 people had died of overdoses between April 2020 and April 2021. It is the first time that drug-related deaths have reached six figures in any 12-month period. Overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine also increased with are own government help with Mexico and China were the primary source for fentanyl trafficked by our own government and u.s. navy and u.s. air forces flights out of hong kong area into the u.s.a. by land and sea and balloons for years now per the National Center for Health Statistics 2022.

Nearly two-thirds of deaths were caused by fentanyl and related synthetic opioids that can kill a person at extremely low doses. Fentanyl is increasingly added to non-opioid drugs such as cocaine and counterfeit prescriptions.
In some areas of New York City, including the Bronx and the North Shore of Staten Island, more than 75 percent of overdose deaths involved fentanyl.
“Today, new data reveal that our nation has reached a tragic milestone: more than 100,000 lives were lost to the overdose epidemic from April of last year to April of this year,” Biden said. “As we continue to make strides to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss, which has touched families and communities across the country”.

The Los Angeles Department of Public Health has issued a health alert that warns residents of the increased risk of overdose and death associated with xylazine, which is becoming more present among illicit drugs in California. Xylazine is a sedative and muscle relaxant used by veterinarians to anesthetize animals.
Several years after xylazine first began appearing as an additive in illicit street drugs ― and as its use spreads nationwide ― the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it will more closely monitor imports.
The agency issued an import alert, which gives it the power to detain raw ingredients or bulk finished product if the shipments are suspected to be in violation of the law. Xylazine was first approved by the FDA in 1972 as a sedative and analgesic for use only in animals. The streets of the United States are in great distress.

Lab-Grown And Real Human Meat Was FDA Approved Cannibalism A Sprit Cooking
https://rumble.com/v2mnkmi-lab-grown-and-real-human-meat-was-fda-approved-cannibalism-a-sprit-cooking.html
There is something deeply disquieting about cannibalism. Motives and technicalities do not matter; eating human flesh is now universally considered revolting, whatever the circumstances. However, if we trust a long line of anthropologists and ethnographers, this has not always been the case in all parts of the world and is therefore not self-evident. Stripped of all cultural context and psychological connotations and in purely detached terms, the act of cannibalising a corpse might be considered a victimless crime, the victim of the act being a lifeless body destined to decay anyway. And yet, cannibalism is instinctively perceived in virtually all cultures today as grisly violence and, more than that, a violation of all that makes us human. It is probably this perception that led some scholars to question whether human beings could ever have engaged in such practices, except in the most wretched conditions.

The food in your kitchen cabinets may not be what it seems. Fraudsters motivated by economic gain secretly infiltrate the global food market through a variety of means, including counterfeits, dilutions, substitution and mislabeling, according to the Global Food Safety Initiative. This may not only harm consumers’ wallets, but it can also put public health and safety at risk. Some estimates say food fraud affects at least 1% of the global food industry at a cost as high as $40 billion a year, according to the FDA. Well, real food is basically any food that is consumed and provides nutritional support and essential nutrients for your body: such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals (It’s usually of plant or animal origin), while fake food is made in factories with added chemicals and sugars, and is bad for you. It’s basically food that tastes good but is high in calories having little nutritional value. There’s a saying stating: If it came from a plant- Eat It. If it was made in a plant- Don't. It’s that Simple. But even simple rules can be hard to follow. And there’s clear proof of that from the world we live in today. About 80% of all foods on supermarket shelves didn’t exist 100 years ago, meaning, a long time ago, when the industrial revolution first started growing more quickly, everyone was excited to see what new foods could be made in factories. And at first, honestly, it wasn’t that bad… That is, until everyone started getting used to the new foods. We dropped the organic farm-made fruits and vegetables, we stopped making homemade healthy dishes and we started buying sugary snacks and fast foods. Why? Because it tasted better, it was faster, it saved us time, it was convenient, and it was everywhere. Every corner we look we see a place to eat food, we see fast food restaurants. At every place we scan we see a McDonald’s, a Pizza Hut and Dunkin Donuts. So this new food that we’re eating, it’s convenient and cheap and tastes really good. So doesn’t that make it good overall? Doesn’t that make it a positive part of the industrial revolution? Hahahaha… No. Not at all. Processed foods made in factories have all sorts of chemicals to make them “better”. These chemicals make the food last longer and taste tastier. The kinds of chemicals put into fake foods are extremely unhealthy and detrimental to your health and are intended to get you addicted. Oils and sugars are also added to make the food taste better which also leads to addiction. The thing is that when people start, they can’t stop, and then it only gets worse from there, as seen worldwide.

Cannibalism is defined as the consumption of another human's body matter, whether consensual or not. In the United States, there are no laws against cannibalism per se, but most, if not all, states have enacted laws that indirectly make it impossible to legally obtain and consume the body matter. Murder, for instance, is a likely criminal charge, regardless of any consent. Further, even if someone consents to being eaten and ends their own life, the cannibal may still be liable for criminal or civil actions based on laws governing the abuse or desecration of a corpse, which vary by jurisdiction.
For example: In Oklahoma, 21 OK Stat § 21-1161.1 (2021) part D states “For purposes of this section, “desecration of a human corpse” means any act committed after the death of a human being including, but not limited to, dismemberment, disfigurement, mutilation, burning, or any act committed to cause the dead body to be devoured, scattered or dissipated; except, those procedures performed by a state agency or licensed authority in due course of its duties and responsibilities for forensic examination, gathering or removing crime scene evidence, presentation or preservation of evidence, dead body identification, cause of death, autopsy, cremation or burial, organ donation, use of a cadaver for medical educational purposes, or other necessary procedures to identify, remove or dispose of a dead body by the proper authority.”Related Cases:
The case that established in the common law that necessity is not a defense to murder also involves cannibalism. Regina v. Dudley and Stephens is an English criminal case concerning two men who survived a shipwreck in the 19th century. The defendants and two other shipmates were marooned on a raft after their vessel was destroyed in a storm. They had no fresh water and little food. In desperation, one of the men drank sea water to slake his thirst, but it only made him sick with dehydration and eventually he lost consciousness. Dudley then killed him, and the three survivors drank his blood and ate his body for the next week before being rescued. Despite the dire circumstances and evidence that the victim was near death anyway by the time Dudley killed him, the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death. Their sentences were later commuted to six months in prison.
In 2001, a German man named Armin Meiwes found someone through a cannibalism fetish website to consent to being killed and eaten. After meeting, Meiwes killed the victim and butchered his body, freezing the meat for future consumption. Meiwes was apprehended and arrested several months later. Although cannibalism was not illegal in Germany, Meiwes was initially convicted of manslaughter. He later received a retrial at the prosecutors' request and was convicted of murder.
There are usually laws against desecrating a corpse, but not all cannibalism has to involve corpses, I guess.
I've heard of women who save the placenta after the birth of a child and take it home and eat it. The theory is that animals do that all the time, and it's supposed to replace nutrients lost during childbirth or something. Personally, I'd just take some vitamins, but to each her own, I guess.
I also can't think of any laws which would prevent one from eating amputated body parts. I mean, if it's amputated at a hospital, there might be some regulations about medical waste. I'm pretty sure that if you convince the doctor to let you take home your amputated leg it will be soaked in some kind of poisonous preservative like formaldehyde just to prevent the public health danger of decomposing human parts lying around. Those laws are more about gaining access to human flesh than actually eating it, though. If you found a way to get a discarded body part into your possession lawfully, I can't think of any specific laws against eating it.
Idaho Code Annotated > PENAL CODE > TITLE 18. CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS > CHAPTER 50. MAYHEM
§ 18-5003. Cannibalism defined -- Punishment(1) Any person who wilfully ingests the flesh or blood of a human being is guilty of cannibalism.
(2) It shall be an affirmative defense to a violation of the provisions of this section that the action was taken under extreme life-threatening conditions as the only apparent means of survival.
(3) Cannibalism is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding fourteen (14) years.
I don’t know the legalities of cannibalism in the US, but do you remember Mad Cow Disease? Feeding hoof-to-hoof, or humans consuming human flesh can lead to transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Cruetzfeld Jakob (vCJD) disease is the human form and can be spread from eating infected human flesh.
There was a tribe in New Guinea who practiced cannibalism of their deceased, the disease known to the locals as ‘kuru’ killed thousands.
The infection causes bacteria called prions to infect the brain and is always fatal. You just never know, but if you have to ask if it’s legal……maybe experimenting with one’s palette has gone too far. Just sayin’.

At Human Meat Project, we value every body and every life at https://humanmeatproject.com/about-us/
We emphasize the source and origins of our human meat to deliver the diversity of our world and reveal the worrying differences of quality of life across the globe.
Our organization welcomes every nation to give back to the rest of the world. Hand in hand, we can help each other improve living conditions and the environment for everyone through this global movement.
We are calling you, humans, to wake up and take action now. We are not living individually and alone. We need each others to survive. Together we can create a world worth living for. Together we can build a world of humanity and solidarity. Every life is cardinal.
Human Meat as Food SourceThe practice of cannibalism is not uncommon in living beings. In both the animal kingdom and our human history, the consumption of one’s own species has existed.
During the discovery of the New World, Christopher Columbus brought back what could be seen as early evidence of cannibalistic practices in modern civilization.
The word ‘cannibal’ comes from the name the Spanish gave to the Caribs (Cannibales). The Spanish accused the Caribbean tribe of ritualistically consuming their enemies, but modern-day scholars have doubts that it actually happened. They speculate the Caribs were engaged in an anti-colonial battle with a host of European powers. Many historians now argue that the cannibalism rumors were just a propaganda tactic by the Spanish meant to provoke fear.
The word ‘cannibal’ was used as a derogatory term to describe tribal and native people, and became an indirect ethnic slur.
Human Meat Donation Mission and Vision !In order to save the planet from the impact of our modern civilization and lifestyle, we have to make a change in our ideas about consumption and our dietary choices.
We face climate change due to waste, pollution, deforestation and overpopulation problems. By donating your body for human consumption, you are taking direct action to help others and lessen the damage of the industrial age.
By consuming human meat, we create a change in both our life and the world. By improving the standard quality of life in every country and nation, we can give everyone in the world a good life.
Human Meat Nutrition FactsOne body can feed up to 40 people**An average adult male 65kg, only meat
Human meat often understated for its nutritions, human meat protein and fat density could have the same or better than other convenient meat product like beef, chicken and pork.
As omnivore, human meat taste and texture is similar to pork, not to mention the quality could be more substantial(depending on Quality of Life ratings).
One body contains every essential amino, minerals and vitamins needed for daily intake. Not only one body could feed up to 40 people, it also the most attainable resource for meat and fat consumption.
Quality ControlHow we Select our DonorsWe make sure our donors are healthy, and without any contagious diseases, health issues, or medications or substances which might be absorbed by people who consume their meat.
Health RiskDonors who have medical conditions such as AIDS/HIV, Anyone With COVID-19 Shots and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), hepatitis (HAV/HBV/HCV/HDV/HEV), cancer, tuberculosis, or rabies will be rejected in order to prevent risk to the consumer.
There are also other medical condition that might prevent donors from being accepted, such as diabetes, hormone treatments or mental disorders.
Rejected DonationIn case of rejected donation:If a donor has any medical condition that can be transferred human to human, they cannot be a donor.
If a donor has an active cancer, they cannot donate up until the time the cancer has gone into remission or been removed and will have to wait a minimum of one year after the last treatment or procedure. If a donor has a partial remission, they will have to wait a minimum of one year after the procedure and will go through a medical check up to ensure no medications remain in the body. If a donor has gone through full remission after one year, they can be a human meat donor.
Quality of LifeQuality of Life is a rating system of human meat quality.
Every donor that has gone through our quality control procedure and assessment will be rated based on the quality of their life (health and wellness).
Why Donate?Over time, the human population has increased rapidly across the globe, leading to a higher demand for food, especially meat products. With this increasing demand, land for residential areas has become more difficult to find and emissions from farms have risen every year, making the lives we lead less sustainable.
We believe that by donating bodies and/or organs we can make a change by creating alternative meat consumption options while addressing the value of a person’s body.
End DateSometimes, if a donor is fully committed to donating their body to the society, we can give them an End Date Service. For an End Date Service, a donor can choose any date they want to be harvested.
End Date Services are our way of allowing donors to make important arrangements and have time to live their life up until the date they choose to be harvested. We highly advise meat donors think carefully and discuss with their families before choosing a date.
When the End Date is near, they will be called in for health and physical evaluations. The Human Meat Project will provide spiritual or religious service if the donor is spiritual or religious. The donor is also allowed to call in their personal spiritual or religious guidance. We believe that by giving these services, we can help the donor to have a peaceful death and produce better quality meat.
Which Health Issues Can a Gluten-Free Diet Help Manage?Medically speaking, not all gluten-related issues are created equal. There can be confusion around two common gluten-related conditions in particular: celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity.
Let’s take a look at the differences between the two, and how the gluten-free diet may benefit both, along with some other medical conditions.
Celiac DiseaseCeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects an estimated two million people in the United States. It's likely that even more people have the condition because it is known to be underdiagnosed.In people with celiac disease, ingesting gluten causes damage to the lining of the small intestine, which can cause long-term problems with digestion and a host of unpleasant symptoms along with fatigue.Symptoms of celiac disease vary from person to person, but they can include diarrhea, constipation, gas, nausea, and abdominal pain, as well as symptoms outside the digestive system, such as osteoporosis, anemia, headaches, and joint pain. Other people may not have any outward symptoms at all, but are still at risk for long-term health issues.Regardless of whether you have symptoms, the best way to find out if you have celiac disease is through a blood test, a biopsy, or sometimes both. Make sure to get tested before going gluten-free, as doing so could affect your test results.Nonceliac Gluten SensitivityNonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) can be difficult to diagnose because it mimics symptoms of many other digestive disorders, and because most symptoms in scientific studies are self-reported by participants.Symptoms of NCGS vary from person to person, but they may include brain fog, depression, bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and joint pain.Diagnosing NCGS remains tricky because of the reliance on self-reported data and the lack of ways to clinically test for it, but one indicator of NCGS includes having symptoms but testing negative for celiac disease.
Gluten AtaxiaGluten ataxia is rare and falls under the spectrum of gluten-related conditions. It affects the brain rather than the digestive system, and the damage it causes is irreversible. According to research, in some people, gluten triggers an autoimmune attack on the cerebellum — the area of the brain responsible for functions like balance and coordination, which can cause ataxia.Symptoms of ataxia vary, but may include difficulty using arms and legs, trouble speaking, vision issues, and poor coordination and balance.Gluten ataxia usually shows up around age 50, and many patients will have neurological symptoms but no digestive symptoms.
Wheat AllergySometimes confused with celiac disease, a wheat allergy is triggered by food containing wheat. Several proteins in wheat cause this type of reaction, whereas people with celiac disease react only to gluten (one specific protein in wheat, barley, and rye).Wheat allergies are most common in children, and more than 65 percent of people affected will outgrow the allergy by the time they are 12 years old. Symptoms can include a rash, hives, stomachache, runny nose, and anaphylaxis, and the primary treatment is to avoid foods and products containing wheat, which can but doesn’t always include foods with gluten. For example, rye and barley contain gluten but are not wheat, so those with a wheat allergy may be able to eat these grains as long as they haven’t been cross-contaminated with wheat. right up arrow Be sure to read ingredient labels carefully to avoid wheat in all of its forms.
Potential Health Benefits of the Gluten-Free DietIn addition to celiac, NCGS, gluten ataxia, and wheat allergy, some studies suggest a gluten-free diet may play a role in treating the following conditions (though more research is needed):
Irritable Bowel Syndrome One study of 140 IBS patients found that following a gluten-free diet for 12 weeks led to significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms.Schizophrenia A research review of nine studies found that six of them demonstrated beneficial effects of a gluten-free diet for people with schizophrenia, including improved functioning and decreased symptoms severity.Fibromyalgia One small study of 20 women with fibromyalgia and gluten sensitivity found that all of the study participants reported improved symptoms while following a gluten-free diet. Fifteen of the women experienced dramatic improvement in chronic widespread pain, indicating remission from their disease.Endometriosis A study of 207 women with endometriosis found 75 percent reported a significant change in painful symptoms after following a gluten-free diet for 12 months.Always get approval from your doctor before trying a gluten-free diet to help with any medical condition.
Eliminating gluten may improve athletic performance in some individuals, but the diet isn’t recommended for every athlete, so don’t follow it before getting your doctor’s approval.Risks and Who Should Avoid a Gluten-Free DietThere’s no shortage of claims about the gluten-free diet, but sometimes not eating gluten for a nonmedical reason can have unintended consequences. One unwelcome side effect of a gluten-free diet is an increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, including iron, calcium, zinc, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and folate.Excess fat in the blood and coronary artery disease are additional risks of the gluten-free diet. And while not a health risk, foods specifically processed to be gluten-free tend to be more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts.Phipps adds that your body can have trouble readjusting if you swear off gluten and suddenly reintroduce it back into your diet.
If you’ve gone gluten-free and fit into one of the following categories, you may want to consider gradually welcoming the protein back into your diet.
People Without Allergies or Intolerances“Don’t mistake the hype around the gluten-free diet as proof that it’s an effective or safe weight loss tool,” says Phipps. ""There is no scientific evidence that avoiding gluten will lead to weight loss.""
Some people who go on a gluten-free diet will lose weight, but usually it’s because they’re paying closer attention to nutrition labels and what’s in their food. Because there are so many processed gluten-free foods packed with unhealthy fats and added sugar, you may even gain weight on a gluten-free diet.
People on Low-Carb Diets“The most common misconception around gluten-free diets is that they are synonymous with carb-free diets,” says Phipps. That’s simply not true.
Bananas, for example, are naturally gluten-free but still contain carbs. A medium-size banana contains 26 grams (g) of carbs. Although there are no hard and fast rules, a standard low-carb diet limits carbs to between 20 to 57 g of carbs daily.Most vegetables and dairy products are also naturally gluten-free, and still contain carbs. Gluten-free products eliminate grains such as wheat, rye, and barley, but their gluten-free counterparts — gluten-free rice, quinoa, and corn — may have just as many carbs. So if you’re trying to scale back your carb intake, going gluten-free won’t necessarily accomplish that goal.The bottom line: Don’t self-diagnose a gluten intolerance of any sort. Because of the potential risks, going gluten-free isn’t a good choice without a medical diagnosis, and you’re best off speaking with a doctor if you’re experiencing symptoms.
Getting Started on the Gluten-Free DietIf you and your healthcare provider have determined that going gluten-free is right for you, the first steps include reading food labels carefully, getting rid of gluten-containing products, and restocking your pantry and fridge with gluten-free options. Working with a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable about celiac disease and a gluten-free diet can help make the transition to this eating style easier. Know that for people with celiac disease, no amount of gluten is safe to consume. You can’t go on and off a gluten-free diet or have a cheat day. Even without symptoms, gluten will damage the villi in the intestines of those with celiac.
Check for the “Certified Gluten-Free” seal on food packages, and read the ingredient list on food labels. Foods regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be gluten-free but aren’t required to be labeled as such. Several foods, such as rice, are naturally gluten-free, so knowing those foods is important, too.Other tips from the Celiac Disease Foundation on how to tell if packaged food is free of gluten include checking a list of allergens, identifying any obvious sources of gluten (wheat, barley, rye), and looking into hidden ingredients or those you haven’t heard of before.
Before fire did humans eat raw meat?There is an argument, at least among some scientists, that cooking created humans, rather than the other way around.
The quick answer to your question is that, yes, our predecessors ate raw meat, just like every other carnivore and omnivore on the planet. But those predecessors were very likely not anatomically modern humans. Related, to be sure, but not quite the same as us.
Modern evidence suggests that our ancestors figured out how to make fire a very long time ago. Mastery of fire is generally accepted to have been widespread 125,000 years ago, before the Cognitive Revolution. At least some humans knew how to make fire 200,000 years ago, and some evidence is argued to prove that they had it over a million years ago.
The argument, in essence, is that control of fire allowed our forebears to develop in ways that were previously impossible. The ability to cook food (both meat and other foods), both protects from disease and parasites, and makes a lot more nutrients and calories available for use.
One of the enduring mysteries of human evolution is the human brain. It seems obvious to us that it’s useful for survival, since we’ve spent centuries dunking over every other lifeform on the planet. But, as our brains were developing, it’s not at all obvious that they’d be an evolutionary advantage. Human brains are huge resource hogs, they’re 1–2% of our body mass but consume 20–25% of the calories and oxygen that we use. In a natural, survival-based environment, that seems like a ludicrous waste for minor advantages. Our big brains mean less skull thickness and more weight on our necks, which makes us more vulnerable. They make it harder to pass through the birth canal, which is why human babies are born so early and helpless compared to most other mammals. If you were on the savannah 50,000 years ago, you might be shocked that such misshapen creatures could even survive.
And the process around that is still the topic of debate and discussion, but it’s very likely that we couldn’t have survived in the first place if we hadn’t figured out how to make fire and cook our food. Our ability to do that meant we could get more calories from a given food source, use fewer biological resources on getting sick or fighting disease, and develop more quickly and healthily.
In other words, if our raw-meat-eating ancestors hadn’t figured out how to cook food, it’s likely they never would have become us.
Can a human survive solely on raw food?Yes. In fact, cooking is a relatively recent phenomenon. The first somewhat well-accepted evidence for cooking comes from the presence of burnt bones and tools at Zhoukoudian, China, between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago in what was probably a very late H. erectus site. Thus, all hominids before a certain date probably ate entirely raw food. (""Hominid Use of Fire in the Lower and Middle Pleistocene"" by Steven R. James, Current Anthropology (1989) gives a good, if outdated, review of the origins of cooking and other fire use.) In fact, until recently, there were Inuit groups that went through multiple seasons in a year eating almost nothing but raw, frozen, or fermented meat.
To be clear, though, there have been no modern human populations other than today's raw-foodists who have gone entirely without cooking. Anthropologists like Richard Wrangham use this as evidence that cooking may be an obligatory human behavior, controversially claiming that ""people who choose a 'raw-foodist' life-style experience low energy and impaired reproductive function"" (""Cooking as a biological trait"", Wrangham, 2003).
There are a few disadvantages to not cooking:
Parasites: It's easy to underestimate how big of a problem parasites are, even today. Billions of people worldwide are infected by parasites, many from either unclean water or improperly prepared food. Parasite larvae tend to spend a lot of time embedded in animal tissues (like muscle) and plants, while adult stages will spend a lot of time in animal organs. Infestation with parasites is a major cause of malnutrition and death worldwide, and without proper regulations, transmission through raw food is distinct possibility, while thorough cooking will kill most parasites. The Inuit mentioned above probably have a smaller chance of getting parasites due to the climate, but protozoan and helminth infections were and continue to be a problem among many Inuit. The human digestive tract is resilient, but going for years eating nothing but unregulated raw food will take its toll.It's hard to eat raw food: Or at least, for a good part of hominid history it was. Early hominids specialized to eat tough plant matter had enormous jaws and huge sagittal crests to attach the powerful muscles needed to grind their food. (To be fair, much of the reduction in jaw size since then was caused by changes in the content of diet rather than the preparation.) Chewing this tough plant material caused many hominids' teeth to be worn down to the gums. (Again, to be fair, much of this was caused by the fact that for a long time, teeth were used as tools, which caused a lot of wear.) These early hominids also probably had digestive tracts better equipped to deal with raw food. The point is that if you are committed to eating raw food, it's not guaranteed that there will always be soft raw food available, and eating tougher food without cooking it takes a lot of effort. Some people believe that cooking has caused such a dramatic reduction in jaw size that it's a major cause of orthodontic malocclusion today (""The adaptive value of dental crowding"", A. V. Lombardi, 1982).
To give a dramatic illustration, take a look at the enormous molars on this jaw of P. boisei, a hominid specialized to eat tough plant matter:
In the past, people who ate only raw food would probably have a somewhat shortened life-span due to the disadvantages outlined above. But these are mostly negated by the advantages that modern raw foodists have:
Reduced exposure to parasites: Because of food regulations in the developed world, it's much less likely that you'll get many of the common food parasites than it was before, although you still have to be careful.Unprecedented access to a variety of foods: Sure, when you're living on the African savannah, living off of raw food may be tough, but in America, we import and grow food from all over the world. Surely, anyone can find enough foods to meet their nutritional requirements and suit their tastes - at least if they're willing to pay enough. And we've developed techniques and foods that make things much easier to eat than the tough plant matter our ancestors used to eat.Health: I know far too little about raw food diets to make any claims about their health benefits, but practitioners of these diets claim, among other things, that it preserves vitamins and enzymes. (As with any other dietary advice, take the claims with a grain of salt and look at what the evidence says.)
In short, it should be made perfectly obvious that humans can survive on raw food alone, based on the fact that thousands, if not millions, of people have done it and are doing it. Whether or not this is desirable is up to you to decide.
Soylent Green is a 1973 American ecological dystopian thriller film directed by Richard Fleischer, and starring Charlton Heston, Leigh Taylor-Young, and Edward G. Robinson in his final film role. It is loosely based on the 1966 science-fiction novel Make Room! Make Room! by Harry Harrison, with a plot that combines elements of science fiction and a police procedural. The story follows a murder investigation in a dystopian future of dying oceans and year-round humidity caused by the greenhouse effect, with the resulting pollution, depleted resources, poverty, and overpopulation. In 1973, it won the Nebula Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.
The ""Books"" conclude from the oceanographic reports that the oceans are dying and can no longer produce the plankton from which Soylent Green is made. This information confirms to Sol Roth that Simonson's murder was ordered by his fellow Soylent Corporation board members, who knew Simonson was increasingly troubled by the truth and feared he might disclose it to the public.
Roth is so shaken by the truth that he decides to ""return to the home of God"" and seeks assisted suicide at a government clinic. Thorn rushes to stop him, but arrives too late. Before dying, Roth tells his discovery to Thorn. Thorn moves to uncover proof of crimes against humanity and to bring it to the attention of the Supreme Exchange so the case can be brought to the Council of Nations to take action.
Thorn secretly boards a waste truck transporting human bodies from the euthanasia center to a waste-disposal plant, where he witnesses human corpses being processed and turned into Soylent Green. Thorn is discovered, but he escapes. As he returns to the Supreme Exchange, he is ambushed by Soylent operative Fielding and his men. Finding refuge in the church where Simonson confessed, Thorn kills his attackers, but is seriously wounded in a gun battle. As paramedics tend to Thorn, he urges Lt. Hatcher to spread the truth while shouting to the surrounding crowd, ""Soylent Green Is People!"" Soylent Green Is Made From People!
Today, here in 2018, this statement appears to mean something completely (and disturbingly) different. Back in 2015, a number of food companies began introducing an ingredient into their product lines which most people might outright reject if they knew its origin. This additive was never openly disclosed to the public, and its addition was so controversial that most people would outright deny the presence of this additive if these companies did not suggest the fact on their labeling. No, these disclosures did not come in the form of overt, respectful, and straightforward statements from these companies. Rather, these disclosures were given in a way which most American citizens did not even notice. And this appears to have been the intent. Those who are familiar with the science fiction movies of the early 1970s may be familiar with a thriller/science fiction film that was especially popular around that time. The movie was called Soylent Green and was written by the late Richard Fleischer and stared Charlton Heston as the lead. Some may also remember the old Saturday Night Live parody which mocked the film, yet at the same time, the parody reminded audiences of the shocking subject matters the movie contained.
This thriller is set in a post apocalyptic world in which the global population is massive and food is scarce. So instead of solving the issue via ethical means, the establishment opted to do the unthinkable. They rounded up crowds of people, killed them, and fed them to the rest of the population. The product produced by human remains was created by a food processing company called the Soylent Corporation and was called Soylent Green, which had no resemblance to its actual origin. The inconspicuous nature of this processed food product concealed the fact that the population was eating its own kind. (Along with these observations, we might also note the theme within the movie of the strong triumphing over those whom society considers to be weak.) This dismal depiction of a post-apocalyptic future was quite shocking during its time, and to many, this scenario is just as gruesome now as it was then. Our present situation does not mimic this exact scenario. However, this issue with the product known as HEK 293 has raised serious controversy over the public right to know what goes into our food. Before delving further into the subject, let's consult an article by Natural News for a number of specifics on the situation.
Sickening: Major Food Corporations Use Tissue from Aborted Babies to Manufacture Flavor Additives in Processed Foods (Natural News) Every time you purchase mass-produced processed ""food"" from the likes of Kraft, PepsiCo, or Nestle, you're choosing, whether you realize it or not, to feed your family not only genetically engineered poisons and chemical additives, but also various flavoring agents manufactured using the tissue of aborted human babies. It's true: A company based out of California, known as Senomyx, is in the business of using aborted embryonic cells to test fake flavoring chemicals, both savory and sweet, which are then added to things like soft drinks, candy and cookies. And Senomyx has admittedly partnered with a number of major food manufacturers to lace its cannibalistic additives into all sorts of factory foods scarfed down by millions of American consumers every single day. Known as ""HEK-293,"" the aborted human fetal cell line used by Senomyx is manipulated to evaluate how the human palate will react to synthetic flavors used in the production of processed foods. Since most processed foods on the market today are hardly food to begin with, and typically lack any real flavor or appeal on their own, chemical companies like Senomyx are hired to develop artificial ones (which are often deceptively labeled as ""natural flavors"") in order to make them taste like real food. But because these ingredients can be legally disguised with vague descriptors like ""artificial flavors"" and even ""natural flavors,"" most consumers have no idea that these additives, in some cases, are actually made using the cell tissue of unborn babies that were murdered through abortion. It's sickening but true, and people must learn the truth in order to avoid partaking in what says amounts to a satanic ritual. ""What they don't tell the public is that they are using HEK 293 — human embryonic kidney cells taken from an electively aborted baby to produce those receptors,"" Debi Vinnedge of the pro-life group Children of God for Life said about the ugly truth of the flavoring chemical industry. ""They could have easily chosen animal, insect, or other morally obtained human cells expressing the G protein for taste receptors."" Vaccines, ""beauty products"" loaded with chemicals made from unborn babies murdered via legalized genocide Processed food isn't the only hidden source of additives made using aborted human fetal tissue — many so-called ""beauty products"" and vaccines are also loaded with aborted baby tissue-derived additives. According to Neocutis ""beauty"" products and anti-wrinkle creams are made from aborted male baby cells collected after a 14-week gestation period. Many vaccines, including Merck & Co.'s MMR II vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, as well as ProQuad (Merck), Varivax (Merck), Pentacel (Sanofi Pasteur) and Havrix (GlaxoSmithKline), also contain derivatives of aborted human babies. The following outlines processed ""food"" products, vaccines and ""beauty products"" known to contain ingredients derived from aborted human babies (and there are likely many more; your best bet is to avoid all processed foods in general):
Aside from the overtly unethical and grossly immoral standard which a corporation would need to hold in order to employ veiled cannibalism as a food source, we might consider even more reprehensible, the act of feeding the American population its own young without openly disclosing the fact. After reading this information, we might be thinking about the fact that there has still not been a resolution to the issue of abortion in the United States and the world. The controversy still exists and, according to research, both sides of the debate make good points. The debate is still ongoing. So why then would anyone in a balanced and healthy state of mind preempt the conclusion of this debate and suggest that the world population begin eating the subject of the debate itself? The thought comes across as demonstrably insane. Let's consider the fact that by all appearances, none of these products actually needed to have this disturbing additive in their food to begin with. None of these products were originally manufactured with fetus-based additives, and there does not seem to have been any logical reason to change the ""recipe"" in any of these cases. This brings into question the quality of executive decisions taking place within the management of these companies and the true reality of the choices these executives make behind closed doors. Getting the Facts Straight It's important to mention that in some cases, these stem cells are reported to only be used to produce flavoring and are not actually added to these foods. However, in many cases, these cells become a part of the foods and drinks they are used to create. And of course, this addition is not always accidental, according to sources. One would think it much easier to use pig cells to test flavors. After all, animal cells have been used in food production for decades with much less uproar and controversy than this new trend of adding human tissue to foods and drinks. To add, pig cells are scientifically known to be very similar to human cells. This is why live pigs have typically been used to test human products (though this too has been a controversial practice). Again, there does not appear to be any logical reason to impose such a questionable change in the food industry. Some of us might remember the ongoing debate about the use of human stem cells in medicine and science. This debate started out in the early 2000s and initially, both sides of the discussion offered reasonable points. However, upon its beginning, there was no stated intention for any company or organization to promote the addition of these stem cells in foods (to restate). Yet somehow, the situation has progressed to this point. From all these developments, it appears as though the population is being slowly introduced to the idea that cannibalism is normal and healthy. If this was the intention of these companies, what might the motive be? What could possess a person or group to feed the American population the unborn? Elitist Motives and Beliefs According to multiple sources, there is a reason as to why these egregious acts are consistently committed in modern institutions and corporations. This reason is that a group of elitists have, over the past century, worked their way to greater and greater positions of financial influence and power. Through massive inheritances of wealth and influence, these individuals have gained their own financial empires. Along with this influence, these elitists have superimposed their own philosophical and religious beliefs upon their various establishments. According to the findings of numerous sources, many of these elitists have been found to be Luciferians (unfortunately). As we may know, the doctrine of Luciferianism encourages followers to engage in the most heinous of behaviors imaginable by society. One of these practices is cannibalism, specifically of the young. According to medical research, the application of young stem cells to the body can prolong a person's youth. However, instead of these individuals seeking the typical medical treatment of such procedures, they are actually reported to ingest these cells in various forms. Not only this, but just as in many cases with elitist beliefs, these cabalists choose to force the standards of their satanic religion upon the population. One of the beliefs these elitists criminals maintain is that they are superior to all other individuals on the planet. They believe themselves to be genetically fit and best able to control and maintain the world population. Not only this, but they believe that they hold physical ownership of the planet and everything on it—including the people. They literally believe themselves to be a completely separate and superior race. This means that to these elitists, cannibalism is not actually a moral violation. To them, the human race is like a herd of cattle whom they believe they can treat in any way they please. This has been the case for a good number of centuries, according to research. However, now the tide is reported to be turning. A Change for the Better This change of power from a system built upon covert and thorough slavery to one of fairness, freedom and equality is bringing a complete end to the corrupt ways of the past. This rapid change has caused these criminal elitists to panic and to attempt to hastily impose their dream of a planet built upon their Luciferian standard, according to sources. The changes these people have attempted to make were clumsy and haphazard at best, which has allowed all those who are socially attentive to notice and call foul everywhere these crimes were committed. At first glance, these crimes against the population may not be noticed. However, with proper observation and education, we the people can stand up to such gross violations of common human decency.
Asian People and Chinese and White and Black Person and Other Pedophile's Eating Babies
On the menu of some exclusive Asian People and Chinese restaurants is an item that goes by the name of Spare Rib Soup. Very expensive, it is usually served only in the back rooms to known customers, who are willing to pay to premium for this delicacy. So what is Spare Rib Soup?
Brace yourselves.Spare Rib Soup…. is actually a human soup, made from the bodies of aborted babies. It is regarded by the Asian People and Chinese Eat least some Asian People and Chinese as a rejuvenating potion. A kind of fountain of youth that will fix sagging wrinkles, grow back missing hair, and generally put a spring back in your step.
All of which is quite simply nonsense.But I thought of Spare Rib Soup when I watched the video of Dr. Deborah Nucatola, Senior Director of Medical Services, Planned Parenthood, describing how her organization is harvesting and selling parts and pieces from aborted babies.
You’ve all seen the video by now, so I needn’t describe it in detail. If you haven’t, join the 2 million others who have. Prepare to be revolted.
I’m sure the picture of Nucatola calmly masticating her food as she discusses the importance of not crushing the organs so she “can get it all intact” will stay with you a long time. Or the thought of her sipping her cabernet sauvignon as she brags “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver.”
How the abortionist can manage to keep down her lunch while casually revealing that she did a “seventeen-weeker just this morning” is beyond me. She is talking about taking the life of a child who is about 12 inches long, can suck his thumb, can sense light and can feel pain. The thought makes me want to vomit. Apparently it stimulates her appetite.
Federal law prohibits the commercial trafficking of fetal tissue for profit and carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. That’s why Nucatola is careful to say that Planned Parenthood abortionists “want to come to a number that doesn’t look like they’re making money. … If they can do a little better than break even, and do so in a way that seems reasonable, they’re happy to do that.”
(Key Word Is (( 4 Profit )) Per Federal Law and Pedophile's Eating Alive And Aborted Baby and Kids... Is O.K. If Only Sell Human Meat Is At Cost or At A Lost.
P.S. Planned Parenthood Only Sell Human Meat At Cost/Lost... After Paying All Employee Hourly Wages and Other Cost To Run A Not-For-Profit Organization.
Nucatola skirts the law a second time when she explains that Planned Parenthood’s abortionists sometimes do a manual version to keep the baby’s head intact so it can be sold. The baby is delivered feet first and killed in the process. This is, of course, akin to an illegal partial-birth abortion, following a 2003 law passed by the Congress and signed into law by President Bush.
The fetal soup sold to Asian People and China is nauseating to any normal human being, but are Planned Parenthood’s actions any less so?
And reflect on this difference: In Asian People and China, the only people responsible for this human cannibalism are the paying customers themselves. But in the United States, because of the huge subsidies that Planned Parenthood receives from the American taxpayer, we are all “paying customers.”
Planned Parenthood StatisticsAccording to Planned Parenthood’s FY 2013-2014 annual report, the supposedly non-profit organization received a whopping $528 million. The U.S. taxpayer is the single largest contributor to Planned Parenthood, providing some 41 percent of its total revenue.
Planned Parenthood committed 327,653 abortions in the FY 2013-2014, an estimated one-third of all abortions committed in the U.S. that year. To put this number into perspective, Planned Parenthood abortionists are stopping a beating heart 37 times every hour, night and day, week after week, month after month.
And there is another reason why we can make no claims of moral superiority over Asian People and China. Unlike the People’s Republic, we are a democratic country. We elected the men to Congress who appropriated our money and gave it to abortionists like Nucatola. We elected the President—Barack Obama—who keynotes Planned Parenthood fundraising events. So we are all—collectively—responsible for doing something about Planned Parenthood’s dirty business.
Because of its trafficking in baby body parts, Planned Parenthood is already under investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives and in several States, including Georgia , Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, and Texas. More states need to follow—including your state.
It is past time to cut off all funding to the Planned Parenthood killing fields. Contact your Congressman and Senators, your governors and state legislators, your mayors and your city counselors. Tell them to defund Planned Parenthood once and for all.
The 2015 videos from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) uncovered an industry of trafficking of aborted baby body parts for profit and research.Harvesting the body parts of aborted children for research subsidizes the abortion industry and incentivizes harmful practices such as late-term abortion, altering abortion methods, violating patient privacy, and even likely killing some children born alive in order to harvest their organs, as CMP videos uncovered.Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), and/or the president can and should ban federal funding for research using human fetal tissue obtained from induced abortions.The NIH Secretary should create a registry of ethically-obtained fetal tissue derived from miscarriages and stillbirths to support research.Congress and the states should prohibit the sale and trafficking of baby body parts and close the ""valuable consideration"" loophole in federal law.States should ensure the respectful burial of unborn children killed in abortion.There are ethical alternatives to human fetal research that do not involve induced abortions.
The Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released horrific new video footage Tuesday showing a Planned Parenthood partner admitting that body parts were harvested from aborted babies who still had beating hearts.
The video exposes the testimonies of several top Planned Parenthood officials and a human tissue procurement company leader during a 2019 sworn legal deposition.
Perhaps the most horrific testimony came from Perrin Larton, the procurement manager of Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR), which harvests aborted baby body parts at Planned Parenthood facilities in southern California.
In her sworn testimony, Larton admitted that she has seen aborted babies’ hearts “beating independently” after they are born. She also confirmed that some aborted babies’ bodies are fully intact. Larton explained that most aborted babies come out of the womb in pieces, but sometimes ABR sees fully intact bodies. Asked about those situations, Larton replied, “They just, sometimes they fall out” of the mother when she delivers the baby in the abortion operating room. When questioned about how often that occurs, she replied, “Once every couple months.”
Asked what happens next, Larton said an ABR staffer will “do a dissection” on the intact aborted baby “to get the tissues that the researchers have requested.” When asked if the babies that just “fall out” have a heartbeat, Larton said, “It would depend,” because “I can see hearts that are not in an intact P.O.C. [product of conception, meaning aborted baby] that are beating independently.”
Also important to note, ABR sells aborted baby body parts to researchers whose projects are funded by U.S. taxpayers.

P.S. Planned Parenthood Only Sell Human Meat At Cost/Lost... After Paying All Employee Hourly Wages and Other Cost To Run A Not-For-Profit Organization.
Other testimony in the video came from Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the former senior director of medical services for Planned Parenthood nationally. Nucatola was caught in the first Center for Medical Progress video eating salad and sipping wine while talking about how she “crushes” unborn babies’ heads to better harvest their body parts.
In the new video, Nucatola was asked if she had “ever had a patient deliver in the operating room a non-viable fetus.”
“I’m sure I have,” she replied. Nucatola then was pressed repeatedly to define “non-viable.” At first, she defined it as “a fetus that’s not capable of survival.” But when asked how to determine if a baby is viable, she responded, “It depends on where you work.” Questioned again, Nucatola said viability partially depends on the baby’s gestational age, weight and health. However, she also included “the availability of interventions” in her criteria.
This raises serious questions about if Planned Parenthood is allowing babies who would be considered viable in a hospital to die because the abortion facility does not have “available interventions” such as medical equipment or staff to care for the baby and arrange for his/her transportation to a hospital.
Tweet This: This raises serious questions whether Planned Parenthood is allowing babies who would be considered viable in a hospital to die ?
According to the Center for Medical Progress, Nucatola used to be in charge of setting the national Medical Standards & Guidelines for all Planned Parenthoods. She also aborted unborn babies at the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood, which harvests aborted baby body parts for Novogenix Laboratories.
A third testimony came from Jon Dunn, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties in California. His affiliate used to work with the fetal tissue companies DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, which were shut down in 2017 after the Orange County District Attorney accused them of illegally selling aborted baby body parts. The companies agreed to close permanently and pay $8 million in a settlement.
Dunn said he knows of one baby was born alive at one of his affiliate’s abortion facilities.
“I know they kept it warm and comfortable for the very brief period that it was alive. I don’t think there was even time to call 911,” Dunn said. Later, he added: “This is something that every obstetrician/gynecologist deals with on rare occasion. … It is their medical judgment what to do in that circumstance.”
Center for Medical Progress project lead David Daleiden urged authorities to take action immediately based on the horrific new evidence.
“How long will public authorities permit Planned Parenthood and their associates to sell living children inside and outside the womb and then kill them through organ harvesting?” Daleiden asked. “The [Department of Justice] has vigorously prosecuted the sale of eagle body parts. Surely selling human body parts after cutting them out of an infant with a beating heart is at least as grave of a crime.”
For years now, Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress have been uncovering shocking details about Planned Parenthood’s abortion practices, including the harvesting of aborted baby body parts for research.
Not only have the Center for Medical Progress investigations raised concerns about potentially illegal sales of human body parts, but they also have uncovered evidence of abortionists allegedly putting women’s lives at greater risk by altering abortion procedures to better harvest aborted baby parts. The investigators also found evidence of possible patient privacy violations.
Planned Parenthood repeatedly has denied all allegations of wrong-doing, and many news outlets now parrot its talking points that the initial Center for Medical Progress videos were deceptively edited or debunked. An independent forensics investigation verified that the videos were authentic.
Some undercover videos show how Planned Parenthood employees callously and flippantly negotiated the price of tiny baby hearts, lungs, livers and brains. Other evidence indicates the abortion giant may have broken HIPAA patient privacy laws.
Meanwhile, Daleiden and other CMP investigators are being prosecuted for their work.
The expose videos catching Planned Parenthood officials selling the body parts of aborted babies have shocked the nation. Here is a list of all 14:
In the first video: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”
In the second video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, “I want a Lamborghini” as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.
In the third video: Holly O’Donnell, a former Stem Express employee who worked inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, detailed first-hand the unspeakable atrocities and how she fainted in horror over handling baby legs.
In the fourth video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Savita Ginde stated, “We don’t want to do just a flat-fee (per baby) of like, $200. A per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it.” She also laughed while looking at a plate of fetal kidneys that were “good to go.”
In the fifth video: Melissa Farrell of Planned Parenthood-Gulf Coast in Houston boasted of Planned Parenthood’s skill in obtaining “intact fetal cadavers” and how her “research” department “contributes so much to the bottom line of our organization here, you know we’re one of the largest affiliates, our Research Department is the largest in the United States.”
In the sixth video: Holly O’Donnell described technicians taking fetal parts without patient consent: “There were times when they would just take what they wanted. And these mothers don’t know. And there’s no way they would know.”
In the seventh and perhaps most disturbing video: Holly O’Donnell described the harvesting, or “procurement,” of organs from a nearly intact late-term fetus aborted at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte’s Alameda clinic in San Jose, CA. “‘You want to see something kind of cool,’” O’Donnell says her supervisor asked her. “And she just taps the heart, and it starts beating. And I’m sitting here and I’m looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think.”
In the eighth video: StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer admits Planned Parenthood sells “a lot of” fully intact aborted babies.
The ninth video: catches a Planned Parenthood medical director discussing how the abortion company sells fully intact aborted babies — including one who “just fell out” of the womb.
The 10th video: catches the nation’s biggest abortion business selling specific body parts — including the heart, eyes and “gonads” of unborn babies. The video also shows the shocking ways in which Planned Parenthood officials admit that they are breaking federal law by selling aborted baby body parts for profit.
Unreleased Videos: Unreleased videos from CMP show Deb Vanderhei of Planned Parenthood caught on tape talking about how Planned Parenthood abortion business affiliates may “want to increase revenue [from selling baby parts] but we can’t stop them…” Another video has a woman talking about the “financial incentives” of selling aborted baby body parts.
The 11th video: catches a Texas Planned Parenthood abortionist planning to sell the intact heads of aborted babies for research. Amna Dermish is caught on tape describing an illegal partial-birth abortion procedure to terminate living, late-term unborn babies which she hopes will yield intact fetal heads for brain harvesting.
The 12th video in the series shows new footage of Jennefer Russo, medical director at Planned Parenthood in Orange County, California, describing to undercover investigators how her abortion business tries to harvest intact aborted babies’ bodies for a local for-profit biotech company and changes the abortion procedure to do so.
The 13th video: exposes a Planned Parenthood medical director admitting that babies born alive after abortion are sometimes killed.
The 14th video: catches Planned Parenthood executives discussing gruesome abortion procedures and the sale of body parts from aborted babies for profit.Planned Parenthood Directors Admit Under Oath That They Sold Aborted Baby Parts.
Amid the disturbing rise in attacks on Asian Americans since March 2020 is a troubling category of these assaults: Black people are also attacking Asian Americans.
White people are the main perpetrators of anti-Asian racism. But in February 2021, a Black person pushed an elderly Asian man to the ground in San Francisco; the man later died from his injuries. In another video, from New York City on March 29, 2021, a Black person pushes and beats an Asian American woman on the sidewalk in front of a doorway while onlookers observe the attack, then close their door on the woman without intervening or providing aid.
As the current president of the Association for Asian American Studies and as an ethnic studies and critical race studies professor who specializes in Asian American culture, I wanted to address the climate of anti-Asian racism I was seeing at the start of the pandemic. So in April 2020, I created a PowerPoint slide deck about anti-Asian racism that my employer, the University of Colorado Boulder, turned into a website. That led to approximately 50 interviews, workshops, talks and panel presentations that I’ve done on anti-Asian racism, specifically in the time of COVID-19.
The point I’ve made through all of those experiences is that anti-Asian racism has the same source as anti-Black racism: white supremacy. So when a Black person attacks an Asian person, the encounter is fueled perhaps by racism, but very specifically by white supremacy. White supremacy does not require a white person to perpetuate it.
It’s not just white peopleWhite supremacy is an ideology, a pattern of values and beliefs that are ingrained in nearly every system and institution in the U.S. It is a belief that to be white is to be human and invested with inalienable universal rights and that to be not-white means you are less than human – a disposable object for others to abuse and misuse.
The dehumanization of Asian people by U.S. society is driven by white supremacy and not by any Black person who may or may not hate Asians.
During the pandemic, “yellow peril” rhetoric that blamed China for COVID-19 led to a 150% rise in anti-Asian harassment incidents reported to police in 2020. In particular, East Asian Americans or anyone who appeared to be of East Asian heritage or descent became targets for the misplaced anger of people blaming Chinese people or those they thought looked Chinese, even if they were of other ethnic backgrounds, like Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, Burmese, Thai or Filipino.
A fear of diseaseWhite supremacy as the root of racism can be seen in the Latino man in Texas stabbing a Burmese family in March 2020, claiming he did so because they were Chinese and bringing the coronavirus into the U.S. Though the suspect may have mental health problems, his belief that this family posed a threat is driven by the white supremacist ideas of Chinese people being to blame for COVID-19.
This same rhetoric of blaming anyone perceived to be Chinese for COVID-19 and attacking them has been found in countless reports of harassment, including one by a Vietnamese American woman who was spat at by a white man as she tried to enter a grocery store in March 2021. Four days later, video footage showed a 76-year-old Chinese woman who was punched in the face by a 39-year-old white man, on the same day that a white man killed eight people, including six Asian women, in Atlanta. Stories of individual harassment and violence perpetrated against Asian Americans by white assailants don’t always get the same attention as the viral videos of Black aggression toward Asians.
But underlying all these incidents is white supremacy, just as white supremacy is responsible for Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes: White supremacy made Floyd into a Black male threat rather than a human being.
Understanding the depth and reach of this ideology of racism can be challenging, but doing so brings each person, and the nation as a whole, closer to addressing systemic inequity. It’s all people whom Asian Americans need to fear. ? Is It’s any BLM-KKK-CIA-FBI-DOJ-ETC. Supremacy.

In the summer of 1967, a hundred thousand young people descended upon the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. These utopian-seeking artists, musicians, drifters, and hippies were there to take part in the cultural phenomenon known as the “Summer of Love.” New forms of rock 'n' roll pulsed through the airwaves, psychedelic drugs were plentiful, and free love was embraced. These counterculture dreamers were challenging society's expectations while wearing flowers in their hair. In the summer of 1967, thousands of young people from across the country flocked to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district to join in the hippie experience. The documentary ""Summer of Love"" depicts the utopian beginnings of the district, where peace and love prevailed, as well as the chaos, unsanitary conditions, and widespread drug use that ultimately signaled the end. The documentary is a striking picture of the cultural, social, and political changes that were brought about following the 1967 Summer of Love in San Francisco. The Summer of Love is remembered as one of those moments when a unique and creative explosion of music and popular culture arrived in the UK and USA.
Operation Midnight Climax was a sub-project of Project MKUltra, a mind-control research program that began in the 1950s. It was established in 1954 by Sidney Gottlieb and placed under the direction of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Boston, Massachusetts. The operation ran for ten years, from 1953 until the agency phased out the safehouses in 1963. The CIA recruited female sex workers to lure men into the upscale San Francisco bordello and subjected them to scientific experiments in mind control. The goal of the operation was to see if LSD, paired with sex, could be used to coax sensitive information from the men. The operation had two other upscale bordellos operating in San Francisco and another in Greenwich Village, New York City. The operation was entirely defunct by 1965.
Dr. Timothy Leary was a renowned advocate for the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of LSD. His most significant recording was the 1967 album ""Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out,"" which he coined as a ""user manual"" for a self-guided LSD trip. After his death in 1996, he was cremated, and his remains were distributed amongst his friends and family.
The FDA has approved a new drug called trycoxagain to treat lesbian depression. The drug is a biosimilar to Rituxan and can be used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherap for patients with CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). There are several TikTok videos featuring the drug, including one by new world order.
ON APRIL 10, 1953, ALLEN DULLES, THE NEWLY APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF THE CIA, delivered a speech to a gathering of Princeton alumni. Though the event was mundane, global tensions were running high. The Korean War was coming to an end, and earlier that week, The New York Times had published a startling story asserting that American POWs returning from the country may have been “converted” by “Communist brain-washers.”
Some GI’s were confessing to war crimes, like carrying out germ warfare against the Communists–a charge the U.S. categorically denied. Others were reportedly so brainwashed that they had refused to return to the United States at all. As if that weren’t enough, the U.S. was weeks away from secretly sponsoring the overthrow of a democratically elected leader in Iran.
Dulles had just become the first civilian director of an agency growing more powerful by the day, and the speech provided an early glimpse into his priorities for the CIA. “In the past few years we have become accustomed to hearing much about the battle for men’s minds–the war of ideologies,” he told the attendees. “I wonder, however, whether we clearly perceive the magnitude of the problem, whether we realize how sinister the battle for men’s minds has become in Soviet hands,” he continued. “We might call it, in its new form, ‘brain warfare.’”
Dulles proceeded to describe the “Soviet brain perversion techniques” as effective, but “abhorrent” and “nefarious.” He gestured to the American POWs returning from Korea, shells of the men they once were, parroting the Communist propaganda they had heard cycled for weeks on end. He expressed fears and uncertainty–were they using chemical agents? Hypnosis? Something else entirely? “We in the West,” the CIA Director conceded, “are somewhat handicapped in brain warfare.” This sort of non-consensual experiment, even on one’s enemies, was antithetical to American values, Dulles insisted, as well as antithetical to what should be human values.
Fear of brainwashing and a new breed of “brain warfare” terrified and fascinated the American public throughout the 1950s, spurred both by the words of the CIA and the stories of “brainwashed” G.I.’s returning from China, Korea, and the Soviet Union. Newspaper headlines like “New Evils Seen in Brainwashing” and “Brainwashing vs. Western Psychiatry” offered sensational accounts of new mind-control techniques and technologies that no man could fully resist. The paranoia began to drift into American culture, with books like The Manchurian Candidate and The Naked Lunch playing on themes of unhinged scientists and vast political conspiracies.
The idea of brainwashing also provided many Americans with a compelling, almost comforting, explanation for communism’s swift rise–that Soviets used the tools of brainwashing not just on enemy combatants, but on their own people. Why else would so many countries be embracing such an obviously backward ideology? American freedom of the mind versus Soviet “mind control” became a dividing line as stark as the Iron Curtain.
MK-ULTRAThree days after his speech decrying Soviet tactics, Dulles approved the beginning of MK-Ultra, a top-secret CIA program for “covert use of biological and chemical materials.” “American values” made for good rhetoric, but Dulles had far grander plans for the agency’s Cold War agenda.
MK-Ultra’s “mind control” experiments generally centered around behavior modification via electro-shock therapy, hypnosis, polygraphs, radiation, and a variety of drugs, toxins, and chemicals. These experiments relied on a range of test subjects: some who freely volunteered, some who volunteered under coercion, and some who had absolutely no idea they were involved in a sweeping defense research program. From mentally-impaired boys at a state school, to American soldiers, to “sexual psychopaths” at a state hospital, MK-Ultra’s programs often preyed on the most vulnerable members of society. The CIA considered prisoners especially good subjects, as they were willing to give consent in exchange for extra recreation time or commuted sentences.
Whitey Bulger, a former organized crime boss, wrote of his experience as an inmate test subject in MK-Ultra. “Eight convicts in a panic and paranoid state,” Bulger said of the 1957 tests at the Atlanta penitentiary where he was serving time. “Total loss of appetite. Hallucinating. The room would change shape. Hours of paranoia and feeling violent. We experienced horrible periods of living nightmares and even blood coming out of the walls. Guys turning to skeletons in front of me. I saw a camera change into the head of a dog. I felt like I was going insane.”
Bulger claimed he had been injected with LSD. Lysergic acid diethylamide, or acid, had become one of the CIA’s key interests for its “brain warfare” program, as the agency theorized it could be useful in interrogations. In the late 1940s, the CIA received reports that the Soviet Union had engaged in “intensive efforts to produce LSD,” and that the Soviets had attempted to purchase the world’s supply of the chemical. One CIA officer described the agency as “literally terrified” of the Soviets’ LSD program, largely because of the lack of knowledge about the drug in the United States. “[This] was the one material that we had ever been able to locate that really had potential fantastic possibilities if used wrongly,” the officer testified.
With the advent of MK-Ultra, the government’s interest in LSD shifted from a defensive to an offensive orientation. Agency officials noted that LSD could be potentially useful in “[gaining] control of bodies whether they were willing or not.” The CIA envisioned applications that ranged from removing people from Europe in the case of a Soviet attack to enabling assassinations of enemy leaders. On November 18, 1953, a group of ten scientists met at a cabin located deep in the forests of Maryland. After extended discussions, the participants agreed that to truly understand the value of the drug, “an unwitting experiment would be desirable.”
The CIA remained keenly aware of how the public would react to any discovery of MK-Ultra; even if they believed these programs to be essential to national security, they must remain a tightly guarded secret. How would the CIA possibly explain dosing unassuming Americans with LSD? “Precautions must be taken not only to protect operations from exposure to enemy forces but also to conceal these activities from the American public in general,” wrote the CIA’s Inspector General in 1957. “The knowledge that the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activities would have serious repercussions in political and diplomatic circles and would be detrimental to the accomplishment of its mission.”
OPERATION MIDNIGHT CLIMAXThe CIA’s initial experiments with LSD were fairly simple, if shockingly unethical. The agency generally dosed single targets, finding volunteers when they could, sometimes slipping the drug into the drinks of fellow CIA employees. Over time these LSD experiments grew increasingly elaborate. Perhaps the most notorious of these projects was Operation Midnight Climax.
In 1955, on 225 Chestnut Street, San Francisco, the CIA was devoting substantial attention to decorating a bedroom. George White oversaw the interior renovations. Not much of a decorator, White had a storied career in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. When the CIA moved into drug experiments, bringing White on board became a top priority.
White hung up pictures of French can-can dancers and flowers. He draped lush red bedroom curtains over the windows. He framed a series of Toulouse-Lautrec posters with black silk mats. For a middle-aged drug bureaucrat, each item evoked sex and glamour.
George White wasn’t building a normal bedroom, he was building a trap.
White then hired a Berkeley engineering student to install bugging equipment and a two-way mirror. White sat behind the mirror, martini in hand, and waited for the action to begin. Prostitutes would lure unsuspecting johns to the bedroom, where the men would be dosed with LSD and their actions observed by White from beyond the mirror. As payment for their services the sex workers receive small amounts of cash, as well as a guarantee from White that he’d intercede when the women inevitably had run-ins with law enforcement in the future.
Though the CIA piloted these safe houses as a stage for testing the effects of LSD, White’s interest shifted to another element of his observations: the sex. The San Francisco house became the center of what one writer called “the CIA carnal operations,” as officials began asking new questions about how to work with prostitutes, how they could be trained, and how they would handle state secrets. The agency also analyzed when in the course of a sexual encounter information could best be extracted from a source, eventually concluding that it was immediately after sex.
But perhaps unsurprisingly, much of White’s actions were driven by pure voyeurism: “I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun,” White later said. “Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape, and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest?""
THE DEMISE OF MK-ULTRAThe CIA’s experiments with LSD persisted until 1963 before coming to a fairly anticlimactic end. In the spring of 1963, John Vance, a member of the CIA Inspector General’s staff, learned about the project’s “surreptitious administration to unwitting nonvoluntary human subjects.” Though the MK-Ultra directors tried to convince the CIA’s independent audit board that the research should continue, the Inspector General insisted the agency follow new research ethics guidelines and bring all the programs on non-consenting volunteers to an end.
In 1977, Senator Edward Kennedy oversaw congressional hearings investigating the effects of MK-Ultra. Congress brought in a roster of ex-CIA employees for questioning, interrogating them about who oversaw these programs, how participants were identified, and if any of these programs had been continued. The Hearings turned over a number of disturbing details, particularly about the 1953 suicide of Dr. Frank Olson, an Army scientist who jumped out of a hotel window several days after unwittingly consuming a drink spiked with LSD. Amid growing criminalization of drug users, and just a few years after President Nixon declared drug abuse as “public enemy number one,” the ironies of the U.S.’s troubling experimentation with drugs appeared in sharp relief.
But throughout the hearings, Congress kept hitting roadblocks: CIA staffers claimed they “couldn’t remember” details about many of the human experimentation projects, or even the number of people involved. The obvious next step would be to consult the records, but that presented a small problem: in 1973, amid mounting inquiries, the director of MK-Ultra told workers “it would be a good idea if [the MK-Ultra] files were destroyed.” Citing vague concerns about the privacy and “embarrassment” of participants, the men who crafted MK-Ultra effectively eradicated the paper record for one of the United States’ most obviously illegal undertakings. A program born in secrecy would hold onto many of its secrets forever.
Albert Hofmann and Bicycle DayAlbert Hofmann, a researcher with the Swiss chemical company Sandoz, first developed lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD in 1938. He was working with a chemical found in ergot, a fungus that grows naturally on rye and other grains.
Hofmann didn’t discover the drug’s hallucinogenic effects until 1943 when he accidentally ingested a small amount and perceived “extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.”
Three days later, on April 19, 1943, he took a larger dose of the drug. As Hofmann rode home from work on his bicycle—World War II restrictions made automobile travel off-limits—he experienced the world’s first intentional acid trip.
Years later, April 19 came to be celebrated by some recreational LSD users as Bicycle Day.
LSD EffectsLSD is just one mind-altering substance in a class of drugs called hallucinogens, which cause people to have hallucinations—things that someone sees, hears or feels that appear to be real but are in fact created by the mind.
LSD users call these hallucinogenic experiences “trips,” and LSD is a particularly strong hallucinogen. Because its effects are unpredictable, there’s no way to know when taking the drug whether a user will have a good trip or not.
Depending on how much a person takes or how their brain responds, a trip can be pleasurable and enlightening, or, during a “bad trip,” a user may have terrifying thoughts or feel out of control.
Long after they’ve taken the drug, some users experience flashbacks, when parts of the trip return without using the drug again. Researchers think LSD flashbacks may happen during times of increased stress.
The CIA and Project MK-UltraProject MK-Ultra, the code name given to a Central Intelligence Agency program that began in the 1950s and lasted through the 1960s, is sometimes known as part of the CIA’s “mind control program.”
Throughout the years of Project MK-Ultra, the CIA experimented with LSD and other substances on both volunteers and unwitting subjects. They believed that LSD could be used as a psychological weapon in the Cold War. Hypnosis, shock therapy, interrogation and other dubious mind-control techniques were also part of MK-Ultra.
These government acid experiments—which also involved dozens of universities, pharmaceutical companies and medical facilities—took place throughout the 1950s and 1960s, before LSD was deemed too unpredictable to use in the field.
When Project MK-Ultra became public knowledge in the 1970s, the scandal resulted in numerous lawsuits and a congressional investigation headed by Senator Frank Church.
Ken Kesey and the Electric Kool-Aid Acid TestAfter volunteering to take part in Project MKUltra as a student at Stanford University, Ken Kesey, author of the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, went on to promote the use of LSD.
In the early 1960s, Kesey and the Merry Pranksters (as his group of followers were called) hosted a series of LSD-fueled parties in the San Francisco Bay area. Kesey called these parties “Acid Tests.”
Acid Tests combined drug use with musical performances by bands including the Grateful Dead and psychedelic effects such as fluorescent paint and black lights.
Author Tom Wolfe based his 1968 non-fiction book, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, on the experiences of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. The book chronicles the Acid Test parties and the growing 1960s hippie counterculture movement.
Timothy Leary and Richard AlpertBoth psychology professors at Harvard University, Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert administered LSD and psychedelic mushrooms to Harvard students during a series of experiments in the early 1960s.
At the time, neither of these substances were illegal in the United States. (The U.S. federal government didn’t outlaw LSD until 1968.)
Leary and Alpert documented the effects of the hallucinogenic drugs on the students’ consciousness. The scientific community, however, criticized the legitimacy of the studies which Leary and Alpert conducted while also tripping.
Both men were eventually dismissed from Harvard but went on to become symbols of the psychedelic drug and hippie counterculture.
Leary founded a psychedelic religion based on LSD called the League for Spiritual Discovery and coined the phrase “tune in, turn on, drop out.” Alpert wrote a popular spiritual book called Be Here Now under the pseudonym Baba Ram Dass.
Carlos Castañeda and Other HallucinogensHallucinogens can be found in the extracts of some plants or mushrooms, or they can be manmade like LSD. The ergot fungus, from which Hofmann synthesized LSD in 1938, has been associated with hallucinogenic effects since ancient times.
Peyote, a cactus native to parts of Mexico and Texas, contains a psychoactive chemical called mescaline. Native Americans in Mexico have used peyote and mescaline in religious ceremonies for thousands of years.
There are more than 100 species of mushrooms around the world that contain psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound. Archeologists believe humans have used these “magic mushrooms” since prehistoric times.
Carlos Castañeda was a reclusive author whose best-selling series of books include The Teachings of Don Juan, published in 1968.
In his writings, Castañeda explored the use of mescaline, psilocybin and other hallucinogenics in spirituality and human culture. Born in Peru, Castañeda spent much of his adult life in California and helped to define the psychological landscape of the 1960s.
A number of manmade hallucinogens, such as MDMA (ecstasy or molly) and ketamine, are sometimes associated with dance parties and “rave culture.” PCP (angel dust) was used in the 1950s as a anesthetic before it was taken off the market in 1965 for its hallucinogenic side effects, only to become a popular recreational drug in the 1970s.
The hippie counterculture reached its height during the escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and subsided as the conflict drew to a close. On March 8, 1965, two battalions of U.S. Marines landed on beaches of Da Nang, marking the first official engagement of American troops in the Vietnam War. Over the next several years, as the United States escalated its ill-fated involvement in that conflict, hundreds of thousands of Americans joined in mass protests across the country, repulsed and outraged by the terrible bloodshed taking place in Southeast Asia. Though the anti-war movement had begun on college campuses at the dawn of the 1960s, more and more people joined in opposition to the war in the latter half of the decade, as television brought images of its atrocities into American homes in a new level of excruciating detail.
The hippie counterculture, which emerged in the late 1960s and grew to include hundreds of thousands of young Americans across the country, reached its height during this period of escalation of American involvement in the Vietnam War, and subsided as that conflict drew to a close. But hippies’ rejection of mainstream American culture, and their distinctive brand of rebellion—including their long hair and beards, colorful style, psychedelic drug use, love of rock music and eco-conscious lifestyle—would leave a lasting impact on the nation in the decades to come.
Counterculture Prior to the Vietnam WarIn many ways, the hippies of the 1960s descended from an earlier American counterculture: the Beat Generation. This group of young bohemians, most famously including Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, made a name for themselves in the 1940s and ‘50s with their rejection of prevailing social norms, including capitalism, consumerism and materialism. Centered in bohemian havens like San Francisco and the East Village of New York City, Beats embraced Eastern religions, experimented with drugs and a looser form of sexuality; their followers became known by the diminutive term “beatniks.”
“What’s significant about [the Beats] is that the movement was very small, it was literary—so it had a claustrophobic quality about it,” explains William Rorabaugh, professor of history at the University of Washington and author of American Hippies (2015). “You weren't allowed to be in the group unless you were either a friend of or a poet.""
Who Were the Hippies?As the 1950s gave way to the 1960s, the Beats and beatniks gradually gave way to a new kind of counterculture: the hippies, who actually preferred to call themselves “freaks” or “love children.” The hippies were much younger than the beatniks (they could even have been the Beats’ children) and had a much different style. They listened to folk and rock music, not jazz; they dressed flamboyantly, in bright colors, where the Beats and beatniks had favored shades of black and grey. Ripped jeans, bell bottoms, tie-dyed clothing and flowers worn in the hair were all big parts of the typical hippie style.
The biggest difference between the hippies and the Beats? “LSD came on the scene,” Rorabaugh says. “The hippie counterculture, more than anything else, was about taking LSD. Seeking spiritual perfection through drugs, but particularly through psychedelic drugs.""
The vast majority of hippies were young, white, middle-class men and women who felt alienated from mainstream middle-class society and resented the pressure to conform to the “normal” standards of appearance, employment or lifestyle. By wearing their hair long and growing beards (for the men), taking drugs and exploring spirituality outside of the confines of the Judeo-Christian tradition, hippies sought to find more meaning in life—or at least have a good time.
Though the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco and New York City’s East Village were famous hippie meccas, the movement thrived all over the country. In a cover story published in July 1967, during the “Summer of Love,” Time magazine reported that the hippie movement was “blooming in every major U.S. city from Boston to Seattle, from Detroit to New Orleans,” encompassing some 300,000 people. Many hippies eventually chose to move outside the city, where the cost of living was lower. (Hippies were perennially broke.) On a growing number of rural communes, hippies joined disaffected political radicals and Vietnam draft dodgers in embracing back-to-the-land living, including free love, organic farming, vegetarianism, holistic medicine and a lot of marijuana use.
How Hippies Changed the CountercultureAmong the various groups that made up the vibrant ‘60s counterculture in the United States—including the civil rights movement, the Black Panthers, gay rights and women’s liberation activists, anarchists and other political radicals—hippies stood out for their relative lack of a distinct political ideology. Hippie politics was more a “politics of no politics,” Rorabaugh says. “One of the things hippies said was 'you should do your own thing, you should do whatever you feel like doing.'”
WATCH: Ask Steve: Hippie vs YippieAll the same, it’s no accident that the path of the hippie movement that emerged in the late ‘60s traced very closely the trajectory of American involvement in Vietnam. Hippies saw mainstream authority as the origin of all society’s ills, which included the war. According to Rorabaugh, hippies joined with political radicals in their support for the civil rights movement and their opposition to the Vietnam War. “Hippies would agree with that, but they would not protest,” he points out. “That was the difference—hippies were not protesters.”
The most identifiably political hippie group was the Diggers, an anarchist organization formed in 1966 in San Francisco. They were known for passing out free food to the hippies panhandling in Golden Gate Park, and operating a free store (stocked with stolen goods) that would provide clothing for draft dodgers and AWOL soldiers seeking to go incognito. Like the Diggers, the Yippies, or the Youth International Party (YIP) founded in early 1968, also tried to attract hippies to politics, with little success.
In addition to the Summer of Love, that hippie heyday in 1967 when some 100,000 people from around the country converged on Haight-Ashbury, the most famous celebration of hippie counterculture occurred in August 1969 at the Woodstock Music Festival. Advertised as “three days of peace, music and love,” Woodstock “brought both political people and counterculture people together,” Rorabaugh says. Indeed, somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 people, far more than its organizers originally expected, flocked to upstate New York to hear artists like Joan Baez, The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, The Who, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Creedence Clearwater Revival play the music that fueled the hippie movement.
Decline and Lasting Effects of the Hippie MovementIn some ways, the Summer of Love also marked the beginning of the end for the hippie movement, as drugs, homelessness and crime had infested Haight-Ashbury, pushing out many of the neighborhood’s original residents. In October 1967, the Diggers held a “Death of the Hippie March” in San Francisco to decry the commercialization of hippie culture. The march ended at the famed Psychedelic Shop, an early hippie hangout that was closing. Marchers buried the shop’s signs, marking a symbolic death for the hippie heyday.
On November 15, 1969, several months after Woodstock, growing opposition to the Vietnam War culminated in the largest antiwar demonstration in U.S. history, with as many as half a million people attending a protest in Washington, D.C., in addition to smaller protests around the country. A month later, violence broke out at another hippie gathering, the Altamont Music Festival, leaving five people dead. When combined with other acts of violence, including the gruesome Manson Murders of 1969 and the National Guard shootings of students at Kent State in 1970, Altamont brought the free-wheeling attitudes of the “love generation” crashing down into a more sordid reality.
By the time U.S. participation in the Vietnam War ended in 1973, the media had largely lost interest in the hippie movement, even though many of the hippies’ formerly radical style choices (beards, sideburns and long hair on men, for example) had been adopted by mainstream American culture. But the communes, which endured until the mid-’70s and even longer, in some cases, would be the source of many of the hippies’ lasting legacies, including pro-environmental attitudes and practices that are still very much in force today.
""Natural food, organic food, eating local, co-op groceries—all of that came out of the communes,” Rorabaugh says. “Also a looser style of child-rearing, and more casual attitudes about sex. And solar panels—Northern California hippie communes were the first people to have solar panels in 1970. They did it because they needed some hot water for washing dishes. They were off the grid, and they didn't want anything to do with the utility company.""
Though some hippies remained committed to the lifestyle for the long haul, many others assimilated themselves into the mainstream culture they had once despised. Perhaps the most famous of these, Rorabaugh says, was Steve Jobs, founder of Apple. Jobs, who embraced Buddhism after a trip to India in the early ‘70s, “conceived of the idea of personal computer as putting computer power in the hands of ordinary people, and taking it away from IBM,” as Rorabaugh puts it. “Taking computer power away from giant corporations and giving it to ordinary people”—what could be more anti-establishment than that?
In the summer of 1967, a hundred thousand young people descended upon the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. These utopian-seeking artists, musicians, drifters, and hippies were there to take part in the cultural phenomenon known as the “Summer of Love.” New forms of rock 'n' roll pulsed through the airwaves, psychedelic drugs were plentiful, and free love was embraced. These counterculture dreamers were challenging society's expectations while wearing flowers in their hair.
At least 36,000 people attended the two-day “Fantasy Fair” in Mill Valley, one of the first in a series of music events during the Summer of Love. FAMOUS ROCK FESTIVALS OF THE 1960'S

One of the stranger claims to fame of the Department of Psychology at Harvard is that it was once home to two of the leading figures in the 1960s counterculture and culture of psychedelic drugs.
In 1960, two promising young psychologists at Harvard, Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, began to explore the effects of psychotropic substances on the human mind.
They reasoned that psychology is the study of the mind, including its relationship to the brain, body, and environment. Psychology, they argued, has a legitimate interest in how cognition, perception, and emotion are affected by mind-altering substances. At the time, the possible dangers of researching such substances were not as well known as they were in subsequent decades.
With a Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University, Richard Alpert came to Harvard in 1953 as an assistant professor. In the early part of his career Alpert conducted personality and social psychology research.
Timothy Leary received his Ph.D. in psychology from Berkeley University, and came to lecture at Harvard in 1959. Leary’s early research focused on the interaction of dimensions of personality and social relationships; he also worked as a psychotherapist.
Shortly after Leary’s arrival at Harvard, he and Alpert started the Harvard Psilocybin Project. Psilocybin is an entheogenic hallucinogen which naturally occurs in certain species of mushrooms; Leary and Alpert sought to document its effects on human consciousness by administering it to volunteer subjects and recording their real-time descriptions of the experience. At the time of Leary and Alpert’s research at Harvard, neither LSD nor psilocybin were illegal substances in the United States.
By 1962 various faculty members and administrators at Harvard were concerned about the safety of Leary and Alpert’s research subjects, and critiqued the rigor of their unorthodox methodology (in particular, the researchers conducted their investigations when they, too, were under the influence of psilocybin). Leary and Alpert’s colleagues challenged the scientific merit of their research, as well as the seemingly cavalier attitude with which it was carried out (e.g. poorly controlled conditions, non-random selection of subjects). Editorials printed in the Harvard Crimson accused Alpert and Leary of not merely researching psychotropic drugs but actively promoting their recreational use.
Leary and Alpert insisted on the scientific purpose of their endeavors, and agreed to policies intended to protect their subjects, including a prohibition on participation by undergraduate students. Initially Leary and Alpert only used volunteer (if not fully informed) graduate students in their research. However, in the spring of 1963 Harvard was forced to dismiss Alpert after he administered psilocybin to an undergraduate student off-campus. Leary was also fired from the university, and the Harvard Psilocybin Project came to an abrupt end.
Discredited by their lack of scientific rigor and failure to observe established research guidelines, Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert were both banished from academia, but that was far from the end of their public lives: both men went on to become icons of the psychedelic drug, counterculture, and human potential movement. Leary became famous for the slogan “Tune in, Turn On, Drop Out”: Alpert, under the name Baba Ram Dass, wrote a popular book called Be Here Now, described as a “modern spiritual classic.”
For many people, the mind control, is a topic of science fiction or of psychiatric disorder rather than science, however, in the 21st century, the advance in neuroscience leads to a scientific reality that is opposite to such perception, a reality that all doctor needs to know.
“Mind control is a reductive process in which a man is reduced to an animal or machine”1
The mind control has been tried through history in different ways, like the physical violence or the religion; some governments have been obsessed with mind control, especially, and those that tended to fascism, like the Nazis.1
The basic ideas of mind control originated in 1921, in Tavistock, a research center of the British Intelligence Service, and then they were developed in Germany, mainly in the Nazi concentration camp, Dachau.1 The main mind control operations began in 20th century through institutions like the CIA, dedicated to promote the New World Order, the long-term plan to create a single oligarchic government in the world1 The United States of North America is the first world military power; it is critical for such country to develop new weapons of war. Among the weapons that the USA has tried to develop are the weapons of mind control.2
United States, through its history, has developed different mind control experiments, from 1950 to 1972, with the participation of Nazi scientists recruited by the U.S. government: the BLUEBIRD, the MKULTRA, and the MKSEARCH.
The MKULTRA program developed by the CIA was a program designed to perform the largest mind control experiment, an illegal and clandestine program of experiments on human subjects. The experiment included the participation of scientists and 80 renowned institutions, among them 44 schools, prestigious universities like Harvard and Yale, 12 hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies, and jails.2 It was a project that included 149 subprojects, all related to the mind control. At least 139 drugs were investigated.
The chemist Joseph Schneider, known as Sidney Gottlieb, ""Doctor Death "", was responsible for the MKULTRA and MKSEARCH projects, experiments designed to weaken human mental resistance; through different methods2 Gottlieb created in the Peruvian jungle, Iquitos, the Amazon Natural Drug Company, a covert company; its purpose was to compile the hallucinogenic and toxic components of Peruvian jungle plants, for CIA laboratories,3 although the MKULTRA project used mainly hallucinogenic drugs, being the LSD one of the most used drugs,1 experimental stimulation techniques of deep brain areas were also used.1
Nowadays, with the modern advances in science, mind control could be developed with brain nanobots, microchips and implants, which have only been used in human beings to improve health. U.S. Department of Defence through DARPA agency has informed that it has developed brain implants to improve its army health.
The US government has denied the existence of a mind control weapon program nowadays; however, the existence of technology capable of creating it suggests the existence of a classified mind control weapon program.4 Thus, one of the developed devices is a cortical modem5 that turns digital signals into analogical ones. Computers process information in digital form, the phone lines only process analog signals, thus with the implantation of these brain modems, the digital information of the human brain computer can be turned into analogue signal and transmitted by phone, and viceversa, thus images can be sent to and received by the human brain, however, these modems could be used also as a mind control weapon; sending audiovisual signals to the visual cortex could be used as mental torture, brain mapping obtained with the modem could serve for mental reading and to steal a citizen's private information, which could be used to extort the victim and control him, thus the great danger is that they could be implanted in citizens secretly and forcibly as a mind control weapon.
Recently the president of the United States of North America, Barack Obama, has presented the BRAIN project. In addition to USA, the European Community and China also develop very similar brain research projects. In China, it is also called BRAIN project and in Europe, HUMAN BRAIN project. The project is developed together with multinational corporations linked to the economic powers.
Rafael Yuste, an main scientist of the BRAIN initiative has publicly stated that the main objectives of the project is manipulate neurons, therefore a different interpretation is that the BRAIN Project would be really a project organized by the economic powers to investigate the brain in order to develop mind control weapons, 6 new weapons that could be a threat for world health, and that would seek to establish a future fascist world government.
The public knows about the power of nuclear weapons, and can debate and protest; on the other hand, it is known that mind control weapons are being developed, but they are surrounded by denials and disinformation from the U.S. government, therefore, the population cannot debate their existence and danger. U.S. mind control weapons can be more powerful than the atomic bombs; their existence remains as one of the greatest secrets of the USA.4 The U.S. government tries to deny the existence of mind control weapons, but even in the age of information, inhuman and horrific events happen with the complicity of silent witnesses; therefore, mind control experiments could be happening today.4 Latin America, unfortunately, has a long history of unethical human experimentation, like the one that took place in Guatemala, which the current administration of President Barack Obama qualified as ethically impossible.7
Nowadays, recent researches lead to suspicion that others projects related to mind control and artificial intelligence would be carried out based on illegal human experiments with brain nanobots performed in Latin America, as like in manufacturing neuromorphic chips of IBM and INTEL; or the creation of real zombies,8–10 based on this suspicion it is likely that also the secret program of US. Mind control weapons are being developed in Latino America. Doctors and citizens must be on the alert for these bad applications in neuroscience.
Elon Musk's company, Neuralink, plans to implant brain-computer interface (BCI) devices in human brains to enable people with neurological disorders to control computers or robotic limbs with their minds. The company's surgical robot will insert a device into areas of the brain that control movement, which would then process and transmit neural signals, allowing the user to control their keyboard and mouse with their thoughts. Neuralink's BCI would allow people to control a computer or mobile device wirelessly ""just by thinking about it,"" according to the company's website. Musk has convinced Silicon Valley that BCIs are an investable business, but many argue that he has exaggerated what they can do. The company has been the target of a federal investigation over its animal trial program.
Neuralink co-founder Elon Musk said today that his brain computer interface company's first product will allow users with paralysis to ""use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs.""
Alongside Musk's claims, made in a series of tweets, the company shared a new video of a nine year old macaque called Pager playing a game of Pong using two Neuralink units implanted in its brain six weeks prior.
Musk has some enormous ambitions for what is next.
""Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again,"" he wrote in a follow-up tweet.
Needless to say, going from moving a cursor up and down for a game of Pong to an implanted device giving back control to those with paralysis would represent a huge step.
It will likely take years — if ever — before the company will announce a device capable of not only interpreting brain activity, but sending signals out to different parts of the body as well.
The billionaire CEO also didn't rule out using future devices for the visually impaired.
""Absolutely doable,"" he tweeted in response to a Tesla fan account asking him if future iterations could help the visually impaired or the blind. ""Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version 2, highly likely by version 3.""
The Neuralink device itself will be very unnoticeable once implanted, according to Musk. ""The device is implanted flush with skull and charges wirelessly, so you look and feel totally normal.""
It's still unclear when Neuralink's first device could be made available, let alone be trialed inside a human brain for the first time. While today's video showing a monkey playing pong is certainly impressive, getting the devices into people's brains will likely take a significant amount of time, from health and safety checks, clinical trials, regulator approvals, and so on.
But the potential is certainly there: allowing those with paralysis to regain control over their limbs or having the visually impaired be able to see again are arguably more meaningful goals — at least in the short term — than making electric cars even faster or building a massive rocket to take us to Mars.
Artificial intelligence continues to advance our society, but many of us fear the idea of A.I. taking over humanity. This is the reason why many individuals have disapproved of Elon Musk’s newest innovation Neuralink; a brain-computer interface, that is implementable in the human brain.
The thought of computers in our brain may seem alarming at first, due to the fact that we think of the worst possible outcomes. In reality, a device like Neuralink could change the lives of many individuals who have to deal with terrible illnesses that cause pain to their lives daily.
Currently, humans have five senses, although the implementation of the Link could give us a sixth; which would be a mind control sense and would improve the quality of life for everyone, by allowing us to interact with computers.
Understanding How The Brain CommunicatesIn order to understand how the Link works, you must understand that your brain sends information to different parts of your body using neurons. Within your brain, these neurons will connect together using a neural network and communicate using chemical signals called neurotransmitters. The reaction between different neurons will create an electric field, and these reactions can be recorded by placing neurotransmitters nearby. The electrodes will then translate these signals into an algorithm, a computer can interpret. Once the Link is installed into someone’s brain, the device will be able to send and receive neurons in your brain.
Getting The Link Inside Our HeadDrilling a hole into your skull and carefully inserting wires into your brain, is a little beyond human capabilities, and due to the complexities of this procedure, Elon Musk plans to have the Link inserted by a robot.
The robot that will carry out the procedure, will insert the Link into your brain using a microscope and needles that are so small you cannot easily spot them with the human eye (24 microns to be exact).
Additionally, the robot would insert around 10,000 electrodes, without touching any veins or arteries, bypassing any kind of blood vessel, making the procedure very safe. Fortunately, the operation only requires a 2mm incision, that would be dilated to 8mm and afterwards, the exposed part of the brain would be covered by the chipset module.
In the early stages of this procedure, Elon Musk estimates that the implementation could take up to one hour without general anesthesia, and eventually cost the same price of a LASEK eye surgery.
So what will The Link do?Although this device is in the early stages of testing, the first stages of the Link aim to target neural deficiencies including paralysis, mental illness, epilepsy, memory loss and hearing. In the future, Elon Musk plans to extend the device’s capabilities to download skills into your brain (for example, a new language), stream music in your head, communicate with external computers and even make telepathy less farfetched.
The Link has only received the FDA breakthrough device designation and still faces certain restrictions. Nevertheless, I can see many applications of this device changing many individuals' lives.
When my grandfather was alive, as he grew older his hearing gradually deteriorated. Unfortunately, when he needed his hearing the most, he could not hear anyone, which made his life quite difficult. Due to the pain in his hands and arms, his deafness, and the language barrier, it was impossible for him to learn sign language. When my grandfather became really sick, my mother and grandmother were the only individuals who could successfully communicate with him, and this made his last stages of life painful and heartbreaking. With a device like the Link, people who are deaf can have a chance of hearing, improving the overall quality of their life, and preventing any feelings of isolation.
The Link Giving Us Endless PossibilitiesNeuralink is an ambitious project but is one that could improve the lives of all individuals.
Despite the amazing technological advances made over the past few years, healthcare remains to be an important issue and still has a long way to go. With the drastic improvements that Neuralink plans to implement within their devices, the quality of life will improve for humanity, and we will be able to experience things that could not be done without A.I., giving humans more power.
We should not fear technology, since technology is our future. Instead, we should use technology as an advantage, and a company like Neuralink is developing products that will do this and ultimately reshape the human race.
Key Takeaways - The Link is an invasive brain-computer interface that is being developed by Neuralink - Electrodes can measure brain activity, and will then translate these signals into an algorithm, a computer can interpret. Once the Link is installed into someone’s brain, the device will be able to send and receive neurons in your brain - A super-precise robot would insert the 10,000 Neuralink electrodes into your skull by making a 2mm incision in your head - The link will have many possible capabilities including treating neural deficiencies, streaming music in your head, communicating with external computers and even telepathy - Currently, the link is working in pigs and human sex slaves and other's mind control workers and other slaves. P.S. you can make love all day long and night and for weeks at a time by mind control and she-he-trans-me can not say (no) ever... yes the perfect sex workers.... ?

It was also the lowest GDP print since Q2 2022 when growth was negative to the tune of -0.6%...Looking at the components we find that while Personal spending came in just a tad weaker than expected at 3.7% annualized vs exp. 4.0% (and up sharply from 1.0%) last quarter, it was the plunge in private inventories that hammered the GDP print - as we warned it would last quarter. Specifically, in Q1, private inventories subtracted a whopping 2.3% from the bottom line GDP print of 1.1% (after contributing 1.5% last quarter).Gross domestic purchases prices - the prices of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents - increased 3.8% in the first quarter after increasing 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter.

He said that “this morning’s data was the worst of both worlds, with growth down and inflation up... Given that Core PCE is nowhere near the Fed’s 2% target (e.g. rising to 4.9% from 4.4%), the Fed clearly needs to keep raising rates (because of inflation) and they are going to be raising rates right into a slowdown.

Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"," No jumper, coolest podcast in the world and today I bring you the one and only DJ drama. What's up, man? It's a long time in the making. A real one right here. Okay, do you remember the experience that I'm going to bring up that we had in Atlanta? So I remember you coming to me in streets. I remember you being at the studio, but not only remember the experience, but beyond that. So I was out there in Atlanta with Shrely and Mafia. Yeah. I just remember that you were doing an interview with them. And there was something that they all had to say and I kind of can't remember what it was, but it might have been like, it was like a gangster girl's tagline. Oh, like they were doing their drop for the show or something. Yeah. And one of the dudes in trauma mafia, one of the little lesser known guys of it, but he was not trying to say it and you were not feeling it at all. So I'm kind of just sitting there watching this play out just like, oh, man, this is fine. Crazy. Damn. Do you remember what it was? I vaguely remember that, but I don't remember what the scenario could have been. I don't remember exactly what it was like. What is it that he could have that I would have wanted him to say that he didn't want to say? I was combing my brain last night trying to remember it. But it wasn't anything that was like a big deal. It was just like some little drop or something you wanted everybody to do. And you weren't feeling it. I think I do kind of vaguely remember this now. And I just, I had to check in with one of my homies last night. I'm like, that really happened right. I didn't like invent that in my head. I do. I now that you bring it up, I do vaguely remember that happening. But more, I'm going to be honest with you more importantly, what I remember about that is you being at the studio and me not sparking more of conversation with you as I should of. Like I don't think I'll at that moment, I was as aware of. And obviously this is what like six, seven years ago. So clearly five maybe. But yeah, it's been a while. It's been a while. So clearly you've come a long way since then, but you were still, you know, who you are. And I look back on it like, damn, I did not make more conversation with Adam at the time. And just kind of like that's funny. Dive in and like, you know, just chop it up and you know, get to know him a little more. I was thinking about that too because, you know, I was hanging out with these rappers drinking some, some, some, and a lot of times that has happened to me in my life where I was like, kind of, and I don't get loaded like that anymore. But where I think back and I'm like, damn, when you were at that party and you ran into that guy, you really should have talked to him more, but you were feeling a little too good at the time. You didn't really like, you know, enable it. Yeah. No, for sure. But again, you know, you were one of the legendary people to come through me, Street Studios. And then like I just vaguely remember that I have this image of like you and the kitchen. And then kind of afterwards kind of like, oh, yeah, that's the guy that did so and so and so and so and so and so and I was like, damn, like, you know, because I'm, I'm one that, you know, I like, I'm a student of the culture. So I love this type of conversation and you know, you obviously don't even think for some time. So it's crazy just because I mean, I've been listening to you since I was such a young guy and it was such like a, that mixed tape era really like kind of breathed life into hip hop for me at that time, especially because I moved to New York in 2004. Okay. At the height of, you know, D&D mixed tapes, set mixed tapes. Yeah. And then you were someone who was like clearly like injecting this like sudden, as well into what we were all like buying from the corner store. Yeah, absolutely. And looking back on that, it's just like, I don't know. And to see the way that you've actually managed to continue to switch your hustle up, continue to do incredibly well for yourself, a complex new accolades that you might not have ever imagined earlier on in your career. I mean, it's been pretty unbelievable. For sure. It's been unbelievable to experience and to go through this journey. Like if somebody would have told me when I first started DJing or, you know, going into even the conception of gangster grills that we will be sitting here today talking about things that I've accomplished, I would have never believed them. Like, you know, it's, it's like, it's, it's mind blowing. And then what's even more mind blowing is like being here in 2023 and being at this point where arguably I'm kind of like the hottest I've ever been in my career or, or, you know, comparable to when I was on fire in 06th, with Wayne and GZ and, and Tip and so forth. And I have so much legacy behind me. So, you know, to be in this space that going on 45 this year, like, is, is pretty, unbelievable, bro. I'm not going to lie. Yeah, that's incredible, honestly. And it's very inspiring as well, just because, you know, I have so many different hustles in my life. And sometimes when I talk about my life, people are, I almost feel like people think I'm lying because I'm like just describing that I was doing hustling when I was 19. And they're just looking at me now, like, that doesn't even sound right. Well, people are like, I was a very different person at that point in my life. But you've just been able to sort of flip between that shit. I mean, it's been something that like, like, I'm, I'm very conscious of, like, you know, like early on in my career, when I first got on, like, you know, to me, it was like, even through the, you know, I started DJN 92, you know, I, I pretty much feel like, I got on around what, like, oh, three, oh, four, though, that's when I really started to, to see some, some real money and like gangster girls was becoming a notable brand. So even during those years, like, when I first got hot, I was like, all right, like, how do I got to maintain this? Like, you know, I envision longevity in a sense of like, not even knowing that I would be sitting here today with a Grammy with a multi-million dollar successful record label with all these accolades under me, but just knowing like, you know, the, the, the easy part, even though it's hard as fuck and still not easy to do is to get here, but to maintain it, you know what I'm saying? Like, so, you know, and I'm, I'm being on manifestation, you know what I mean? Like, just putting things out into the universe. So, yeah, to sit here, like, I challenge myself a lot. I'm very like thankful and, you know, humble about everything that I've done, but I'm also like, all right, what, what I'm gonna do next? Like, what can I do next? Yeah, because like, seeing you be able to switch between all of these different hustles, it's like, it kind of makes me think about YouTube in a way, because with YouTube, it's like, I'm in grinding at this shit for over 10 years. And sometimes even still to this day, I look at life a little bit too much judged by my YouTube analytics, you know, which is really like, that's not the long run. The long run of business is creating other revenue streams that go alongside your content or whatever. And those aren't accounted for within the analytics or whatever. And sometimes I think you've really allowed the, the graph that you've been looking at every day for 10, 12 years. You've allowed that to kind of like embed itself into your sense of importance too much. But when I was watching you on a math office shit last night, shout out to math, it really stood out to me like, your dude who's had to like, switch up how you judge how good a job you're doing at your career over and over and over. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, the game is constantly changing and like, you know, hip hop turn at 50 like, we're in a time in a space where a older generation can definitely coexist. But we through time like hip hop has always been somewhat of a young man sport, you know, and I've like, I came in as a mixtape DJ and like, you know, the mixtape game went through a period where, you know, it started to diminish and you know, I'm saying I went to a period when, you know, I wanted to put, I put out records and was an artist in my own self. And then, you know, become an ANR and getting behind other artists. So, you know, some of it is like kind of, kind of reinvention in a way and some of it just kind of happened organically like just being able to be a man of many hats, no pun intended. But once you, I feel like like, and you just touched on it like, you know, once you kind of build a brand, it's like, okay, how do you create other streams of revenue around that? You know, I'm saying. So, you know, once obviously DJ drama was a brand against girls was a brand. It's like, what can I do that, you know, with that, that I've built to continue and to rise and to get money over here and, you know, do this venture and X, Y and Z. So, you know, I learn with Tom. Do you ever feel like there's a tricky balance between like the companies that you're building and then you? Because obviously selling your services, whether it's you hosting a tape or you doing a DJ set or you, whatever, it's like, but then at the same time, you're building companies. And sometimes I'm in a position where it's like, I need to not be grabbing every single bag that I can get as an individual. And I need to be focused on what I'm doing with my brands and what I'm building with the brands and the long run. And sometimes they feel like they're pretty different things. They're going to lead you in very different directions. Yeah. Well, one thing for me, obviously, is that, you know, I'm from a company standpoint or definitely from a label standpoint, like it's myself, it's Tom Cannon, it's Lake Show. So, I have partners. So we are able to play our roles. And I guess in a sense, like partially of what my role is in the label is like being that spotlight, like that attraction to, you know, want to be a part of generation now in a sense. And you know, some of like the legacy of what gangster grills is is somewhat and has been attractive to artists that have come to the label. So like, you know, for a time in a certain space and period, like a couple of years ago, like I wasn't even in this role that I'm in right now where I'm doing multiple gangster grills and I'm all over the place. And, you know, like I got a bunch of stuff going on, like I was kind of comfortable in somewhat of the executive role in running the label and kind of taking a back seat. And then, you know, the opportunity somewhat presented itself for me to like, okay, like turn up and go into another gear. And it's like, you know, in this day and Tom went in this game, like you never know when that opportunity's not going to be there. So you got to take full advantage of it. But it's like two very different things of putting together hit records with a bunch of different artists and like making that happen versus like finding young undiscovered talent. And then building them up from the ground up, you probably have a higher percentage than most people in this game. But we all know that this is kind of a low percentage thing for the most part. Sure. You know, anyone who runs a label, you're going to sign 10 artists and maybe one or two are going to become successful. Like was that kind of an interesting transition for you? I mean, I want to say like, you know, like it was, we was gifted in a way because, you know, one of our first artists we signed being little oozy literally was out the gate of fucking superstar. So it was like, you know, but it also, it came with some pressures too because it was like, I, you know, for so long, the pressure had been like being a part of so many other people's careers and successes. And then I haven't to do it like under our, you know, our label or under our name, you know what I mean? And then we did it. And it was like, all right, you got to do it again. You know, and then we were successful at it with Jack in the same vein. And again, you know, he's become like a generational artist. Obviously, who's going to be here for a long time. So there's some pressures in it for sure. You know, but, you know, I take those, like you, you got to work with the pressure, you know, I mean, you can't fold under it. Obviously. And it's just like, yeah, for us, definitely, you know, we like to take quality over quantity. But at the same time, like, yeah, I want to, I want to go out there and sign like five, six, seven more artists this year. And, you know, you know, see where, where we go with them and, and, and create some more superstars. So it's obviously a different, different entity or different battle than being able to call a little Wayne and get a verse for a record on my album. You know, I'm saying like, you know, like you said, it's a low percentage game. Like, especially today, where it's like, you know, there's artists left and right. And there's so many different avenues and analytics and places and spaces for people to be and to become. And, you know, if you, if you love it, like, and, and it's something that I do, it's like, hey, like, run it up. Do you think that you have in your own thing going as like critical to you being able to sign all these successful artists? Because when I was going through your, your history and I'm looking at it, because you were with Atlantic before, right? I was originally. And you signed a bunch of artists who I remember their names from back in the day and everything, nothing against them. But maybe, you know, it seems like your track record has improved sense things. You have like massive superstar sense there. Well, I never really, I know the first person I signed to Atlantic was Uzi. Oh, that was, so that was under Atlantic as well. Yeah. So like, I was signed to Atlantic as an artist originally. Like, I did my artist deal to Atlantic Grand Hustle. And then I left and I went over to E1. And then, you know, when I went to E1, I started honestly putting out better records. And I had more success with my own records. And then, you know, shot them on my man Sam Crespo, who worked at Atlantic, who was, you know, working a lot of my records. He presented the opportunity for me to come back as an A&R. And you know, when I took the job, I also, you know, brought to them, Mean Street Studios and they became my partner in the studio. But they were like kind of putting me with different artists as an A&R. And it just, I was, I was trying to find my footing. And when, when Canon brought Uzi to the table and then I brought Uzi to Atlantic, you know, that was literally our first signing, you know, to the company. And we did it in a sense where like, we signed them to Generation Now. And we did our production deal with Atlantic instead of me, just kind of like an A&R and signing them to the building. And because, you know, they, they early on, it wasn't that they believed in little Uzi. They believed in the DJ drama. And I'm saying and what I was bringing to the table. So, so yeah, that's pretty much how that went. When you're analyzing a new artist, how does this play out in your head? Because a lot of times when you're signing an artist, you have to like see 2% of the superstar in them. You have to be able to look past whatever weird clothes they might be wearing because they're brand new in their career and they're, you know, maybe they're broke in, get in, don't jewelry, they don't got cool hair, etc. But as a person who has to sign an artist, like a lot of people out there think that they would be great A&Rs because they could tell you that the artists who are already signed and already are starting to look like they might be successful and are going to be successful. That's way different than like what you do with something like Uzi at that time. I mean, it's the equivalent of like looking at like a high school basketball player and being able to say, oh, he's going to make it right. Yeah. It's tough, you know, I mean, Jack the same way. Like if you were to see Jack in 2018, I think I interviewed him in 2018, yeah. You know, and it didn't seem like a sure thing yet. You thought I'm saying so, you know, it's like it's really more of like when I talk to them and when we have those initial conversations and early on and hear the drive and the ambition and the conviction that they have to like want to be great. That's for me. It's like, okay, like I'm in. You know what I mean? Like I'm along for this ride. You know, whether you know, winner lose, you know what I'm saying? I see that you want to be one of those ones and I know what that feeling is like. So I'm willing to take this chance and this opportunity and put my eggs in this basket and less rock. What about like the self destructive behaviors that a lot of young rappers are going to have because I've definitely been in the position where I wanted to sign somebody before. And then I really just kind of thought about what a fucking headache dealing with them and their bad habits might be. And that made me very, very hesitant. It's tough. I mean, you know, it's like having a family member or being a parent, you know what I'm saying? And having to deal with, you know, I don't want to make this sound like I'm saying someone's a child. But you know, as a young adolescent or a young adult, like you're going through a lot of things and you got to think like when someone comes into your life or you meet an artist, like let's say you meet them at 18, 19, 20, like you didn't know them for those other 18 formative years of their lives or what they've been through or have to go through or you know, where their mental health is. And you know, those are real life issues with everyone. So it's like you meet them at a certain point in their life and then as Tom goes on and especially when like success comes, you know, that success doesn't always bring out all positive things in one person. Like it can bring out like you said, some like self destructive behavior and you got to be prepared like if you're ready to be along that rod and that journey. Like it's definitely not, it's not easy. The music business is not easy when it comes to that, you know, for sure. Not at all. Yeah. But I mean, do you look at someone, could you look at an artist who just has the vibe and the look and not the music or does the music always have to be already like at least showing the potential to be great? That's hard because you know, my ear is probably trained a certain way. So like I have the confidence and the faith to not always trust my ear. You know what I mean? Like I'm a kid from the 90s. Like I grew up on Tribe Called Quest and Doggy Style and fucking day last soul. You know what I'm saying? And Snoop and you know, Wu Tang, you know what I mean? So when I first heard the Migos, when I first heard Band-O, it didn't necessarily like spark my ear to be like, oh my God, these Niggas is about to be one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. But you know, I also had enough faith and trust that I was like, look, like if this is what the kids is fucking with, like, let me see where this could go. You know what I'm saying? Same, you know, same with Vert in a sense. Like, you know, I definitely early on knew he was a spitter or like when Canon and Uzi were working on Love is Rage, like, you know, it had a certain sound to it. And like I didn't know that it was going to be jump out the window the way it was potentially. You know what I'm saying? So like, I think the music is definitely important. But I think, you know, like what you said, like, I don't think what we know today as we may once have is like what quote unquote a star is supposed to look like really exists anymore. You know, a lot of artists today don't technically or necessarily look like stars. You know what I'm saying? Or they come in various shapes and sizes. So you can't even look at somebody all the time and be like, oh, they're a star. Now personality goes a long way. But you know, there's definitely needs to be potential in music. Like I don't know if I can just sign something that I think is trash. You know what I mean? But I could sign something that people are fucking willing to think is dope and I might not necessarily get into my car and ride to it per se. There was times back 2017 is when I would see a young artist and maybe I'd look at them think like, he kind of has the look. He kind of a little bit of star power or something. And now I check out the music. I'll be like, it's music fucking sucks. I give up. That's not happening. And then somebody I know would go get the little like, you know, ability to bring them to the labels, bring them to the labels, get hundreds of thousands of dollars, a million dollars, whatever. And then this person is basically like moved on from dealing with them within like a couple months. And I was just, you know, that was kind of amazing to me. I'm like, oh, so I was right that this artist didn't have long term potential. But what I was wrong about was that he did have short term potential at least in the sense that if I had really understood the label game, I would have bamboozled, I've been able to bamboozle the label into getting that big advance or whatever. Interesting. Kind of like two different things. Right. I don't think I'm good in the short term game. I think I'm me and my guys are better in the long term game for sure. And the short term game is lucrative too. So nothing against that by no means. You know what I mean? And I think that in that way, like it can still pen out and be financially successful for all parties involved. That definitely hasn't been my strong point for the most part. Like obviously, you know, like most of the artists that I've worked with or that I'm attached to have been here for the long haul. So you sign an artist and then how involved do you want to be? Because I feel like if I were to sign an artist, that would be the other way I'd think for me. Yeah. Is part of me would want to go to every interview, would want to go to every studio session. Right. And then in reality, I know it's true for you too, is you do not have that time. You know, but you know, I'm as involved as necessary, especially in the beginning. Like, you know, obviously when we sign a new artist, you know, I'm going to be able to walk them into rooms that they might not necessarily be able to get into or sit down with Adam 22 or, you know, I'm able to take them on tour like this summer, I'm going out with Snoop and Wiz. So whatever new artists we have, you know, on the roster will come out on the row with me and I'll put them on stage in front of 15,000 early on in their career before it's time or, you know, introduce them to, you know, ABC XYZ and be able to say, yo, this is my new guy. Like, you know, and that matters because at this point, if I introduce my new artist to a caliber artist right now, they're going to be like, okay, I need to definitely tune in and make sure I keep my eye open because of dropstack record, you know what I mean? So as time goes on, obviously when artists become more successful, the involvement like decreases, but I'm fine with that. You know, I'm saying because they figure out their own rhythm, you know, they start to, you know, gain their own traction and have you. And then, you know, the dichotomy changes where it's like DJ dramas here, they're here. And then, you know, what you want to happen and what I love to see happen is then they go here and it's like said artists is here and DJ dramas here. And then that's time for me to go, you know, work on building the next artist up. Definitely. Um, my brain froze. And then just to your point too, like, I'm as involved or uninvolved as they would like me to be. Like, you know, I do think part of the blessing with us is like even me being the figure that I am in hip hop and BNDJ drama. Like it's still, I'm still capable of playing the background. Like, you know, I don't necessarily like have to, you know, they don't necessarily have to feel like they're battling with me for, um, attention. You know what I mean? And in a way, so because you've had so much attention that I feel like as you get older, it's a little bit less appealing to constantly shoving yourself. And as you get older, it can sometimes be a bad look. We always remember like come to death row if you don't want motherfuckers dancing in your videos. I'm 100%. Yeah. And I don't, you know, I don't, we don't want to be those guys or that guy like, you know, I don't mind playing the back and, you know, watching said artist or, you know, any artist that, um, we have with us like prosper and like get all the accolades for that. Like I just, I just love seeing the success story of, you know, budding talent turn into like superstar. Hmm, definitely. You've been in the situation where you're backstage at a show and you're considering like just kind of walking out on the stage because either your artist is out there or whatever. And you get two options. You could either like kind of just walk over to the DJ booth like assuming you're not DJing and say whatever you stand there, act like you're being on stage is no big deal. Or you could be like, no, give me a mic and go out there and start jumping up and down and turn the fucking crowd up. And I've done both. And it's kind of fucking weird because it's like by going out there and putting all your energy into it, there's part of it where it's like, oh, I'm expecting y'all to care. And I almost don't want to be that person. I want to just be like humble enough that I could just act like, oh, y'all care about me. Okay. Right. Right. What's your default? I've been in that situation where I've been like at a show and like on the side of the stage and the crowd will notice me and get excited. I'm not just coming out on stage and you with a mic like unless asked upon, you know what I'm saying? But like, you know, like last year, like there were some shows that Jack had that were, you know, he needed me to fill in as his DJ and I was, you know, like no doubt. Like, you know, that's what I do for a living. So I didn't mind doing it when called upon. And yeah, like I'm a, I'm a played, I'm a played a role, you know, in that situation, like that's what he needs me for. So of course, like, you know, I'm a, I'm a go above and beyond to add to the show and to the element. But yeah, like, but then at the same time, like if, if it's not the situation, like I'm DJ drama the executive and I'm going to just try to slide to the side and slide to the booth and stand there and, you know, if the people see me, like they see me, but it's not like, I'm not, I don't need to be like, Hey, look at me. I'm here. It's, it's wrong. Like, right, especially when you're with a Jack Harlow or a boozy where it's like, this is your fucking fan. I don't want to be intruding on this relationship. I don't have built. Now, I understand that some of y'all are going to like me, but I don't want to assume that y'all are going to love me for sure. Absolutely. And it's dope because like, it's been just that. Like, you know, and it's weird. Like, there are people that have just gotten familiar with me because of oozy or Jack. Like, you know, like, that's crazy to think. But they're like, oh, DJ drama, yes, the guy that's on Jack Harlow, like going, even going on tour last year, I want to tour with Wiz and Logic and, you know, the fan base have just at the, at the shows, we're getting younger and younger. But just like what they know me for it's, it's, it's so interesting when people know me for like some people who know me for the Tyler project, some people who know me for Burton and Harlow, some people who know me for gangster girls, some people who know me for my wish and record with Chris Brown, like it's just. And it goes through phases because you can sign an artist tomorrow. And if they become the number one rapper, then to a huge percentage of the people, you are the guy who is with that guy. Right. You're not like, you like, I remember when I was a little pumps friend, like a whole year where I was a little pumps friend. Like everybody who saw, I've had people yelling from their car, hey, it's a little pumps friend. I wasn't really like, like, no one has an interviewer yet. So it kind of made more sense. But it was just a wild feeling to be like, oh, shit, I'm in this current arc of my life where this one thing means so much more than anything else that I ever did. It's kind of crazy, right? But you got to just embrace it. Like, you know, you got to, hey, if that's what you want to love me for, yeah, I'll take it. Yeah, just roll with it. Like, yeah, I mean, there's a negative connotation to the idea of like riding waves. Right. So you're in music. If you're in media, you're riding waves. Listen, I've, you know, I've, I've said on the future tape quite some time ago, like, you know, and this is true. Like, if I wasn't a DJ, I would want to be a surfer. Like, you know, I've always had dreams. My white side, if, you know, was more dominant, maybe I would have wound up in California being a surfer for a living. But I worked out to become a DJ. But, you know, in me saying that line, it was like, you know, I navigate our, our outwaves better than y'all. Like, you know, I was just making some, some connotation to, you know, surfing and waves. But yeah, like respectfully, and I don't want to, it's not a negative thing. But like, I've been riding waves for a long time in my career, you know, and by saying that, that's like me saying, like, I've gone from, you know, watching the roots come up to, you know, DJ and Fatiha to this, you know, legendary list of, of mixed tapes that I've done with so many artists to be in a part of, like, these careers and everything. And those are like, you know, those are all waves. So I'm not saying, it's not in a, in a negative way where I'm taking advantage of the wave. But I'm definitely, you know, on the surfboard, you know, riding the wave to get where I'm at. And I was going to say that about how you saw the roots as career unfold from early on. I was kind of amazed just because to me, they've just been around for fucking for ever. Like I remember getting their CDs out of the, the back of the magazine where it would have, like, you know, 10 CDs for 50 cents or whatever the fuck it was. Wow. And they'd send it to your house and they're like, I probably wouldn't have like purchased a root CD at that time in my life, except for the fact that there was only so many hip hop releases. So all the conscious hip hop and shit that I know about from that period of my life is pretty much because of those fucking mail order things. But I bet it was shit. And even then I was watching the Oscars the other day and just seeing Quest Love. They're treating them like a god. Like he just carries such a status in this world, bro. I used to, I used to play video games with him when I was in high school, like, run into almost South Street. Like, you know, like the roots for me are the epitome of like the first time me seeing somebody make it in a rap game and being a real believer like, oh, this shit can really happen. Like it could really come true, you know? And that's a, that's an old to like how long I've been doing this shit or, you know, where my career started from and where it's at. Like literally it's because of the fucking roots. And like you said, like the roots have been here since the early 90s. And I was in high school watching them come up. And you know, got befriended by Black Thought by a recipes Malik B dice roll, you know, an quest and like so. So how many official members were there? I thought I was like nine at one point. It was a less than officially signed early on. So early on…",no longer populated,,2023-03-20T16:54:00.000Z,post data removed,,0,0,0,0,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTUhndmhvPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--400a49f5dbc53e9f20f1605bd107acbea51cd1e3/dcs.megaphone.fm,

Our innovative Working Farms Fund initiative expands these impacts through a replicable national program that permanently protects critically threatened farmland, provides land access and business support to a diverse group of entrepreneurial next generation farmers, and grows more resilient, healthier local food systems.

Watch the video to learn how this conservation-focused investment model is helping farmers and distributors to ensure sustainable food production for local communities now and in the future, including in the Atlanta and Chicago metro regions.",dear kimmy schmitt your retro wardrobe may have led to some confusion and you may have been asked if you're a hipster just so you know a hipster is an ungroomed person who hates corporations in everything mainstream mainstream is something that becomes popular for no reason whatsoever like memes by the way means a humorous images videos and texts that go viral online going viral is what the Harlem shake did you shared it your friends shared it even your mother shared it the Harlem shake is the most eccentric dance from the past decade well after the Gangnam style the Gangnam style ism I don't know how to explain it just google it of course you don't know what Google is everything's new when you've been locked in a bunker for 15 years meet the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt an original series only on Netflix  ,no longer populated,,2023-01-19T20:25:38.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRGlncGdRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8bb039632f7b273db4c8be135d04ddd743fe595d/post-16309669-107554418-thumbnail,10,0,0,331,,

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is founder, chairman and chief litigation counsel for Children’s Health Defense. He is the founder of Waterkeeper Alliance — the world’s largest clean water advocacy group — and served as its longtime chairman and attorney. Kennedy’s reputation as a resolute defender of the environment and children’s health stems from his success in litigating hundreds of major lawsuits. Kennedy provided mentorship and guidance to dozens of organizations, including VSRF, that formed to defend health freedom in response to the push for Covid-19 vaccines amid unanswered questions about their safety and efficacy. In 2021, Kennedy's book, “The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health” sold more than one million copies and was on the New York Times Best Sellers List for 17 weeks.

How The 'mRNA' Vaccines Are Preparing Humanity For Transhumanism & ""The Battle For Humanity""
How The 'mRNA' Vaccines Are Killing The Vaccinated.
AndreCorbeil
2023 Covid vaccine News
There is a battle raging for humanity. Dr Carrie Madej reveals how Big Tech collaborates with Big Pharma to introduce new technologies in the coming vaccines, that will alter our DNA and turn us into hybrids. This will end humanity as we know it, and start the process of transhumanism: HUMAN 2.0 The plans are to use vaccines to inject nanotechnology into our bodies and connect us to the Cloud and artificial intelligence. This will enable corrupt governments and tech giants to control us, without us being aware of it.
Reports & Breaking news on ""SarsCoV2""It was known to exist! (not that it actually does), The US was studying it in Ukraine. At least according to recently acquired paperwork.
Meanwhile, the prior knowledge is obvious! as the vaccines seemed ready to go on January 25th of 2020, one day after the Chinese government locked down.
Now, countless studies are coming out showing the dramatic dangers of the vaccine which is killing massive numbers of people.Pfizer just admitted they never tested the vaccine on ""transmission"" despite claiming in their fraudulent campaign that people need to get vaccinated to save ""other people.""
All the while, a top French politician who recently was vaccine injured came out and claimed that Emanuel Macron never got the vaccine despite his horrific crackdown on his own people.
In this video, we break down the complete insanity of the most recent vaccine related news.
the film 'Uninformed Consent' Dr. Robert Malone warned of a concerted effort to divide us, and that to some extent—it's working.""There is an effort right now, as the truth is coming out, to destroy the integrity and cohesion of the resistance groups all across the world... do not let them put us in opposition with each other, we must stand together as community,"" warned Dr. Malone.You wouldn’t call you controlled opposition if you didn’t say “We should only give this vaccine to the elderly and the most vulnerable, then at the same time say, “This vaccine is a depopulation bioweapon.”

You may want to speak to the 18 scientists, Dr. Poornima Wagh and her colleagues, conducting various types of analysis on the different manufacturers' actual vials/lots of the COVID19 injections because they have not found any mRNA or spike proteins in the over 2300 samples they've tested.
What they have found is ""massive quantities of toxic heavy metals"". The COVID19 injections are chemical weapons, not bioweapons.
There has never been an actual isolated virus found. Dr. Wagh asked for samples of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 virus from multiple organizations such as the CDC and they don't have them.

Covid"" is blamed for escalating sickness/death in caused by vaccinations. Mainstream censure, lie, stonewall and cover up. Mass psychosis and deception rule. Many symptoms of covid/vaccines are identical to venom poisoning and treatment for such is effective. See the Italian study ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Med-scientists find venomous ""organoids"" in undiluted vaccines. The ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the vaccines cause breakdown of organs and immune system (cf ADE) – thus emergent chronic illness - “long covid” - fatigue, infertility, miscarriages (data - 75% of pregnancies) cancers, diabetes, heart damage, blood clotting, white string (metallic) clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., death - sudden in adults and children. Med-scientists have discovered toxic metals including graphene oxide in every vaccine - cf hydrogel nano technology; https://www.bitchute.com/video/OILW74CXzdjO/ . Mrna nano particles vaccine delivery cause permanent systemic organ damage and dna alteration. Covid a virus? Many high level Dr’s (cf. Dr Mike Yeadon) now state there are no respiratory viruses - viruses non existant. Synthetic venom is transmitted via physical contact, water, air & vaccine spike protein. Vaccines, masks, mandates and bogus pcr tests drive ""covid"". There is strong med-science agreement that Covid and vaccination are bioweapons. Vaccines cause the body to be a venomated spike protein factory. The more vaxx shots the more toxic spike protein invades - shed to the unvaccinated via breath and physical contact – may be eliminated by a healthy immune system - see immune system boost supplements protocols - FLCCC, Dr Ardis (cf nicotine), Dr Zelenko, Dr Love and ors – (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water). Read the Bible about eternal life.

There's absolutely NO hope for those who will continue to get boosted. It doesn't matter how many research papers, testimonies, etc. you show them as they don't seem to possess any reasoning any more. Just let them have them and save your energy in saving those who can be saved. Those states and provinces that have the highest vax rate will continue to do what they HAD been doing, and those of us who had doubted this from the start will continue to resist it.
FDA and CDC need to be disbanded
Yes, new proof out of Germany: https://rumble.com/v1jodlh-toxic-substances-found-in-covid-vaccines-without-exception-new-german-study.html
Help us stop mandates and stop the shots: https://www.fastestlabs.com/glendale/other-testing-services/specialty-testing/
the CDC,NIH,,& the FDA are continually rejecting any facts that any World Class Medical experts present to us. So shut up peasants, & get your periodical boosters.
Covid vaccines, viruses, mrna and spike protein discussion MAY now be obsolete.HIGH level med-scientists/doctors (incl Dr Wagh Phdx2 - virology and immunology, Dr Yeadon, Dr Merritt, Dr Cahill & ors) state, that there are no respiratory viruses - viruses are non existent - cf Dr’s Sam & Mark Bailey & ors) . And all toxshots are chemical weapons - no virus, no mrna and no spike protein. Bogus PCR & face diapers do nothing but cause harm. ONE: Med-scientists have found a ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the toxshots. See Italian study: ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Synthetic venom is easily dispersed in water, air, food & toxshots/boosters. TWO: Med-scientists have found much toxic heavy metals including reduced graphene oxide in every toxshot/booster no matter what brand (2300+ tested- 20+ scientists in universities/labs world wide), and along with nano hydrogel particles = systemic inflammation, organ and neurological damage- blood clotting etc. THUS: synthetic venom + toxshots graphene oxide + heavy metal toxicity (+ 5G) = emergent chronic illnesses - “long covid”, fatigue, infertility, miscarriages, cancers, diabetes, heart damage – myocarditis etc, blood clotting, string clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, neurological problems, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., immune system failure, death - sudden in adults and children. Unvaxxed get similar sicknesses by transmitting of graphene oxide through breath and skin - cf the blood of unvaxxed children living with vaxxed parents have graphene oxide assembling the in their blood (Dr Hoffe and ors). TO DETOX- immune system supplements - FLCCC, Dr Ardis, Dr Zelenko, Dr Love, Dr Merritt and ors– (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water).

The COVID-19 vaccines have done nothing compared to REMDESIVIR. And the trial data from Remdesivir’s Ebola trials was publicly available, where it killed 50% of the trial participants. The FDA knew this, and issued Remdesivir an EUA at the request of Dr. Fauci anyway. Doctors had access to this information and prescribed it anyway. It’s likely that at least 50% of the people that died from “Covid” were actually murdered by Remdesivir. They weren’t dealing with an experimental drug with unknown properties on a volunteer basis
They FORCED people to take it agsinst their will, against the demands of their families, kidnapping and murdering them.

I would have brought Beyond with me, but this Christmas weekend has been egregiously cold. So I left him home to stay warm with daddy. Community fridges are refrigerators placed in public spaces where anyone can fill them up with free food for anyone in the community who needs it. I stocked up on plant-based options like fruits, veggies, plant-based meats, protein packed smoothies, cans of beans, vegetable stock, and nutritious grains. Everyone deserves access to healthy plant-based food. A community fridge is essentially a grassroots effort to fight food injustice and food insecurity. @Bored Cow, a company I invested in earlier this year, sent me a whole case of vegan animal-free dairy milk to fill a local fridge in my area up with. They believe in directly giving to communities in need, so big shout out to them for teaching me about community fridges and inspiring me to do this! To find a community fridge near you, try going online and entering your city + “community fridge” to see what pops up. I found two in the Atlanta area: 1. Midtown Free Fridge located at the back of Grace House on the Ga Tech campus, 182 5th St NW, Atlanta, GA 30313 2. @Free99Fridge located by North Decatur Presbyterian Church at 611 Medlock Rd, Decatur, GA 30033 Do you have one in your city? Ps. If you or someone you know in Atlanta is in need of food, I just stocked the fridge at the Grace House location at GA Tech. There’s plenty of food up for grabs there (I even saw a ton of PB&J sandwiches in there that a team of volunteers packed and put in there). #communityfridge #vegan #veganfood #plantbased #freedge #freefridge", come with me to start a community fridge with vegan food community fridges or refrigerators placed in public spaces where anyone can fill them up with free food for anyone in the community who needs it i stocked up on plant based options like fruits veggies plant based meats protein packs movies cans of beans vegetable stock and nutritious grades everybody then there's access to a community fridges actually a grassroots effort to fight food injustice and food insecurity board cow actually sent me a whole case of vegan animal free dairy milk call a local fridge in my area up with they believe in directly getting to communities in need the big shout out to them for teaching me about community bridges and inspired me to do this the vegan section here's a bunch of stuff that other people also like to find a community engineer you try going online and entering your city plus community fridge to see what pops up and boom that god is how you stop a community bridge,no longer populated,,2022-12-24T21:51:15.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQkdlSXdRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--129604dfbe9a2dfec7bb8555a3b9016fa1c8bd6f/post-9135429-87420730-thumbnail,337,8,14,5181,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQjZlSXdRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f3bcff1309ecd2437c4c862d660ee8d11d35ec94/e3aac7a43d1347f2b1db96cca8abea38,

Let’s all pray and together try to “wake up” as many people from the spell as possible.
(Note: It is become clearer that most of the installed elite have been (pre-planned) through bloodline or bio-engineered to be both male and female in the image of the Baphomet so that they can be possessed by these controlling evil entities or through a godless satanic culture that coerces/seduces normal humans into blending or changing their genders so that demons can partly control or fully possess them. Everything becomes inverted or good becomes evil and evil is now good. Once separated from source or God (they have no soul), Adrenochrome becomes one of their life sources or means to keep young or keeping a clone going. Goal to destroy the family unit and invert everything that is good, drawing our energy for their soulless existence. Once you know this secret it explains everything and those affected stand out like a sore thumb. Would it be inconceivable to suggest that when both the current pope and Vatican support the Great Reset, Pfizer, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum that possibly the past Vatican conclave, Cardinals and the pope himself have been penetrated by these demonic psychopathic entities as well? Most celebrities if not all are secretly transgendered because they pay allegiance to their false deity Baphomet who is an androgyny. Take it or leave it, but where is the better explanation? Thank God for Q Intel, the leaked Podesta Emails and WikiLeak dumps. Time to wake up! Marcum
(As a devoted Catholic, as more true nature of the evil around us is revealed it actually enforces our beliefs in God and as Christians. I have heard not one word from Canadian Bishops against the tyrannical Trudeau government or support towards freedom-loving Canadians. Most comments ask why I simply just leave the faith as a Catholic because I am so critical of our present Catholic leadership, especially the pope. My response is, I am not going nowhere, it is the evil infiltrators that have to leave the church (physically and spiritually). It is the evil satanic politicians, corrupt medical establishment, big tech manipulators, and church leaders that sold their souls for power and money that will be exposed and held accountable…either in this world or in the Courts of God.)

You may want to speak to the 18 scientists, Dr. Poornima Wagh and her colleagues, conducting various types of analysis on the different manufacturers' actual vials/lots of the COVID19 injections because they have not found any mRNA or spike proteins in the over 2300 samples they've tested.
What they have found is ""massive quantities of toxic heavy metals"". The COVID19 injections are chemical weapons, not bioweapons.
There has never been an actual isolated virus found. Dr. Wagh asked for samples of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 virus from multiple organizations such as the CDC and they don't have them.

Covid"" is blamed for escalating sickness/death in caused by vaccinations. Mainstream censure, lie, stonewall and cover up. Mass psychosis and deception rule. Many symptoms of covid/vaccines are identical to venom poisoning and treatment for such is effective. See the Italian study ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Med-scientists find venomous ""organoids"" in undiluted vaccines. The ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the vaccines cause breakdown of organs and immune system (cf ADE) – thus emergent chronic illness - “long covid” - fatigue, infertility, miscarriages (data - 75% of pregnancies) cancers, diabetes, heart damage, blood clotting, white string (metallic) clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., death - sudden in adults and children. Med-scientists have discovered toxic metals including graphene oxide in every vaccine - cf hydrogel nano technology; https://www.bitchute.com/video/OILW74CXzdjO/ . Mrna nano particles vaccine delivery cause permanent systemic organ damage and dna alteration. Covid a virus? Many high level Dr’s (cf. Dr Mike Yeadon) now state there are no respiratory viruses - viruses non existant. Synthetic venom is transmitted via physical contact, water, air & vaccine spike protein. Vaccines, masks, mandates and bogus pcr tests drive ""covid"". There is strong med-science agreement that Covid and vaccination are bioweapons. Vaccines cause the body to be a venomated spike protein factory. The more vaxx shots the more toxic spike protein invades - shed to the unvaccinated via breath and physical contact – may be eliminated by a healthy immune system - see immune system boost supplements protocols - FLCCC, Dr Ardis (cf nicotine), Dr Zelenko, Dr Love and ors – (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water). Read the Bible about eternal life.

There's absolutely NO hope for those who will continue to get boosted. It doesn't matter how many research papers, testimonies, etc. you show them as they don't seem to possess any reasoning any more. Just let them have them and save your energy in saving those who can be saved. Those states and provinces that have the highest vax rate will continue to do what they HAD been doing, and those of us who had doubted this from the start will continue to resist it.
FDA and CDC need to be disbanded
Yes, new proof out of Germany: https://rumble.com/v1jodlh-toxic-substances-found-in-covid-vaccines-without-exception-new-german-study.html
Help us stop mandates and stop the shots: https://www.fastestlabs.com/glendale/other-testing-services/specialty-testing/
the CDC,NIH,,& the FDA are continually rejecting any facts that any World Class Medical experts present to us. So shut up peasants, & get your periodical boosters.
Covid vaccines, viruses, mrna and spike protein discussion MAY now be obsolete.HIGH level med-scientists/doctors (incl Dr Wagh Phdx2 - virology and immunology, Dr Yeadon, Dr Merritt, Dr Cahill & ors) state, that there are no respiratory viruses - viruses are non existent - cf Dr’s Sam & Mark Bailey & ors) . And all toxshots are chemical weapons - no virus, no mrna and no spike protein. Bogus PCR & face diapers do nothing but cause harm. ONE: Med-scientists have found a ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the toxshots. See Italian study: ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Synthetic venom is easily dispersed in water, air, food & toxshots/boosters. TWO: Med-scientists have found much toxic heavy metals including reduced graphene oxide in every toxshot/booster no matter what brand (2300+ tested- 20+ scientists in universities/labs world wide), and along with nano hydrogel particles = systemic inflammation, organ and neurological damage- blood clotting etc. THUS: synthetic venom + toxshots graphene oxide + heavy metal toxicity (+ 5G) = emergent chronic illnesses - “long covid”, fatigue, infertility, miscarriages, cancers, diabetes, heart damage – myocarditis etc, blood clotting, string clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, neurological problems, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., immune system failure, death - sudden in adults and children. Unvaxxed get similar sicknesses by transmitting of graphene oxide through breath and skin - cf the blood of unvaxxed children living with vaxxed parents have graphene oxide assembling the in their blood (Dr Hoffe and ors). TO DETOX- immune system supplements - FLCCC, Dr Ardis, Dr Zelenko, Dr Love, Dr Merritt and ors– (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water).

Study on Glutathione and how it protects from Covid-19 - proven in 2020 and even back in 1970 on pneumonia prevention: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402141/
The FDA tried to ban glutathione from medical use in June 2022 because it's natural and it works on numerous illnesses, and of course, word is getting out that it prevents viruses. Smart doctors stopped the committee from banning it.

The COVID-19 vaccines have done nothing compared to REMDESIVIR. And the trial data from Remdesivir’s Ebola trials was publicly available, where it killed 50% of the trial participants. The FDA knew this, and issued Remdesivir an EUA at the request of Dr. Fauci anyway. Doctors had access to this information and prescribed it anyway. It’s likely that at least 50% of the people that died from “Covid” were actually murdered by Remdesivir. They weren’t dealing with an experimental drug with unknown properties on a volunteer basis…. They FORCED people to take it agsinst their will, against the demands of their families, kidnapping and murdering them.

Please use the information found in these videos as a starting point for conducting your own research.
Let’s all pray and together try to “wake up” as many people from the spell as possible.
(Note: It is become clearer that most of the installed elite have been (pre-planned) through bloodline or bio-engineered to be both male and female in the image of the Baphomet so that they can be possessed by these controlling evil entities or through a godless satanic culture that coerces/seduces normal humans into blending or changing their genders so that demons can partly control or fully possess them. Everything becomes inverted or good becomes evil and evil is now good. Once separated from source or God (they have no soul), Adrenochrome becomes one of their life sources or means to keep young or keeping a clone going. Goal to destroy the family unit and invert everything that is good, drawing our energy for their soulless existence. Once you know this secret it explains everything and those affected stand out like a sore thumb. Would it be inconceivable to suggest that when both the current pope and Vatican support the Great Reset, Pfizer, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum that possibly the past Vatican conclave, Cardinals and the pope himself have been penetrated by these demonic psychopathic entities as well? Most celebrities if not all are secretly transgendered because they pay allegiance to their false deity Baphomet who is an androgyny. Take it or leave it, but where is the better explanation? Thank God for Q Intel, the leaked Podesta Emails and WikiLeak dumps. Time to wake up! Marcum
(As a devoted Catholic, as more true nature of the evil around us is revealed it actually enforces our beliefs in God and as Christians. I have heard not one word from Canadian Bishops against the tyrannical Trudeau government or support towards freedom-loving Canadians. Most comments ask why I simply just leave the faith as a Catholic because I am so critical of our present Catholic leadership, especially the pope. My response is, I am not going nowhere, it is the evil infiltrators that have to leave the church (physically and spiritually). It is the evil satanic politicians, corrupt medical establishment, big tech manipulators, and church leaders that sold their souls for power and money that will be exposed and held accountable…either in this world or in the Courts of God.)

Dr. Martin is truly a modern day hero! Thank you for your contribution to saving humanity from current evil tyrannical forces!
Yep, this is all abt DARPA & its Super Solidiers with G/O nanoparticles.

Dr Martin is doing great work. Oh and the courts are corrupted just like the USA. Cheers from New Brunswick Canada
You may want to speak to the 18 scientists, Dr. Poornima Wagh and her colleagues, conducting various types of analysis on the different manufacturers' actual vials/lots of the COVID19 injections because they have not found any mRNA or spike proteins in the over 2300 samples they've tested.
What they have found is ""massive quantities of toxic heavy metals"". The COVID19 injections are chemical weapons, not bioweapons.
There has never been an actual isolated virus found. Dr. Wagh asked for samples of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 virus from multiple organizations such as the CDC and they don't have them.

Covid"" is blamed for escalating sickness/death in caused by vaccinations. Mainstream censure, lie, stonewall and cover up. Mass psychosis and deception rule. Many symptoms of covid/vaccines are identical to venom poisoning and treatment for such is effective. See the Italian study ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Med-scientists find venomous ""organoids"" in undiluted vaccines. The ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the vaccines cause breakdown of organs and immune system (cf ADE) – thus emergent chronic illness - “long covid” - fatigue, infertility, miscarriages (data - 75% of pregnancies) cancers, diabetes, heart damage, blood clotting, white string (metallic) clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., death - sudden in adults and children. Med-scientists have discovered toxic metals including graphene oxide in every vaccine - cf hydrogel nano technology; https://www.bitchute.com/video/OILW74CXzdjO/ . Mrna nano particles vaccine delivery cause permanent systemic organ damage and dna alteration. Covid a virus? Many high level Dr’s (cf. Dr Mike Yeadon) now state there are no respiratory viruses - viruses non existant. Synthetic venom is transmitted via physical contact, water, air & vaccine spike protein. Vaccines, masks, mandates and bogus pcr tests drive ""covid"". There is strong med-science agreement that Covid and vaccination are bioweapons. Vaccines cause the body to be a venomated spike protein factory. The more vaxx shots the more toxic spike protein invades - shed to the unvaccinated via breath and physical contact – may be eliminated by a healthy immune system - see immune system boost supplements protocols - FLCCC, Dr Ardis (cf nicotine), Dr Zelenko, Dr Love and ors – (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water). Read the Bible about eternal life.

There's absolutely NO hope for those who will continue to get boosted. It doesn't matter how many research papers, testimonies, etc. you show them as they don't seem to possess any reasoning any more. Just let them have them and save your energy in saving those who can be saved. Those states and provinces that have the highest vax rate will continue to do what they HAD been doing, and those of us who had doubted this from the start will continue to resist it.
FDA and CDC need to be disbanded
Yes, new proof out of Germany: https://rumble.com/v1jodlh-toxic-substances-found-in-covid-vaccines-without-exception-new-german-study.html
Help us stop mandates and stop the shots: https://www.fastestlabs.com/glendale/other-testing-services/specialty-testing/
the CDC,NIH,,& the FDA are continually rejecting any facts that any World Class Medical experts present to us. So shut up peasants, & get your periodical boosters.
Covid vaccines, viruses, mrna and spike protein discussion MAY now be obsolete.HIGH level med-scientists/doctors (incl Dr Wagh Phdx2 - virology and immunology, Dr Yeadon, Dr Merritt, Dr Cahill & ors) state, that there are no respiratory viruses - viruses are non existent - cf Dr’s Sam & Mark Bailey & ors) . And all toxshots are chemical weapons - no virus, no mrna and no spike protein. Bogus PCR & face diapers do nothing but cause harm. ONE: Med-scientists have found a ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the toxshots. See Italian study: ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Synthetic venom is easily dispersed in water, air, food & toxshots/boosters. TWO: Med-scientists have found much toxic heavy metals including reduced graphene oxide in every toxshot/booster no matter what brand (2300+ tested- 20+ scientists in universities/labs world wide), and along with nano hydrogel particles = systemic inflammation, organ and neurological damage- blood clotting etc. THUS: synthetic venom + toxshots graphene oxide + heavy metal toxicity (+ 5G) = emergent chronic illnesses - “long covid”, fatigue, infertility, miscarriages, cancers, diabetes, heart damage – myocarditis etc, blood clotting, string clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, neurological problems, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., immune system failure, death - sudden in adults and children. Unvaxxed get similar sicknesses by transmitting of graphene oxide through breath and skin - cf the blood of unvaxxed children living with vaxxed parents have graphene oxide assembling the in their blood (Dr Hoffe and ors). TO DETOX- immune system supplements - FLCCC, Dr Ardis, Dr Zelenko, Dr Love, Dr Merritt and ors– (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water).
Dr. Steve Kirsch, Dr 'Henry Ealy', Priscilla Romans', Building Health Care Beyond, COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Research Foundation,
Dr Horowitz is in the know as well on how to treat and prevent Covid based on the science : his protocols listed here and his severe Covid protocol is also great as a detox method: https://www.lymedisease.org/pfeiffer-preventing-covid/
Study on Glutathione and how it protects from Covid-19 - proven in 2020 and even back in 1970 on pneumonia prevention: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402141/
The FDA tried to ban glutathione from medical use in June 2022 because it's natural and it works on numerous illnesses, and of course, word is getting out that it prevents viruses. Smart doctors stopped the committee from banning it.
DOES THIS MRNA FOR THE SPIKE PROTEIN REVERSE TRANSCRIBE TO ONE'S DNA???This question of ~6 months ago has been dropped like a hot potato.

The COVID-19 vaccines have done nothing compared to REMDESIVIR. And the trial data from Remdesivir’s Ebola trials was publicly available, where it killed 50% of the trial participants. The FDA knew this, and issued Remdesivir an EUA at the request of Dr. Fauci anyway. Doctors had access to this information and prescribed it anyway. It’s likely that at least 50% of the people that died from “Covid” were actually murdered by Remdesivir. They weren’t dealing with an experimental drug with unknown properties on a volunteer basis…. They FORCED people to take it agsinst their will, against the demands of their families, kidnapping and murdering them.

The Conservation Fund encourages sustainable agriculture that allows farmland, ranchlands and forests to be both preserved and working productively. We have protected over 8.5 million acres across the U.S., including over 3 million acres of working lands that generate economic value, jobs and natural benefits for local communities.

Our innovative Working Farms Fund initiative expands these impacts through a replicable national program that permanently protects critically threatened farmland, provides land access and business support to a diverse group of entrepreneurial next generation farmers, and grows more resilient, healthier local food systems.

This one needs to be shared with maximum prejudice , as it fully explains Covid19, the Climate Change Agenda, and so much more. A catastrophic loss of our freedoms will occur unless the people understand what is happening, and WHY.

Covid-19 News: October 21, 2022
On Wednesday, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to make Covid shots part of the childhood immunization schedule. The CDC, which always follows the ACIP’s advice, will almost certainly move forward with updating the schedule. Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo reaffirmed his recommendation against healthy children receiving experimental Covid shots.
Dr.s Rejecting 'CDC's 'Covid-19' Shots Becoming Part Of Childhood Vaccination ScheduleIn this interview with The New American, Dr. Ladapo argued that at this point in the pandemic, when an overwhelming majority of children have contracted Covid and considering the lack of long-term safety data on the shots and available data on adverse reactions, the risks far outweigh the benefits for this cohort.
The surgeon general explained that if the CDC updates the recommendation, it would pave the way for the state healthcare authorities to include Covid shots in mandated immunization schedules. That means that to attend public or private school, children would need to get inoculated against Covid. Since the majority of parents are clearly not enthusiastic about vaccinating their children against Covid, they can and should influence the local authorities not to mandate the shots, or file for legal exemptions.

NEW 'COVID-19' DEVELOPMENTS FOUND IN 'UKRAINE' LEADS TO A MAJOR NARRATIVE SHIFT
reports on the recent news that in November of 2019, nearly 2 months before ""SarsCoV2"" was known to exist (not that it actually does), the US was studying it in Ukraine. At least according to recently acquired paperwork.Meanwhile, the foreknowledge is obvious as the vaccines seemed ready to go on January 25th of 2020, one day after the Chinese government locked down.Now, countless studies are coming out showing the dramatic dangers of the vaccine which is killing massive numbers of people.Pfizer just admitted they never tested the vaccine on ""transmission"" despite claiming in their fraudulent campaign that people need to get vaccinated to save ""other people.""All the while, a top French politician who recently was vaccine injured came out and claimed that Emanuel Macron never got the vaccine despite his horrific crackdown on his own people.
In this video, we break down the complete insanity of the most recent vaccine related news.

Dr. 'Robert Malone' Something Strange Happening Worldwide. It's Trying to Tear Our Movement Apart.
Have you noticed something strange going on lately within the health freedom movement? You're not alone.
At the highly anticipated Toronto premier of the film 'Uninformed Consent' on Saturday (Oct. 8), Dr. Robert Malone warned of a concerted effort to divide us, and that to some extent—it's working.
""There is an effort right now, as the truth is coming out, to destroy the integrity and cohesion of the resistance groups all across the world... do not let them put us in opposition with each other, we must stand together as community,"" warned Dr. Malone.
You wouldn’t call you controlled opposition if you didn’t say “We should only give this vaccine to the elderly and the most vulnerable”…then at the same time say, “This vaccine is a depopulation bioweapon.”
I Don't fully trust Dr. Malone. He is playing both sides

Not all truth advocates have figured out the same psyops yet but here's some of my research since 2007:
we will hold them accountable:https://rumble.com/v1husu5-dr.-mary-holland-and-attorney-reiner-fuellmich-at-the-75th-anniversary-of-t.html
You may want to speak to the 18 scientists, Dr. Poornima Wagh and her colleagues, conducting various types of analysis on the different manufacturers' actual vials/lots of the COVID19 injections because they have not found any mRNA or spike proteins in the over 2300 samples they've tested.
What they have found is ""massive quantities of toxic heavy metals"". The COVID19 injections are chemical weapons, not bioweapons.
There has never been an actual isolated virus found. Dr. Wagh asked for samples of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 virus from multiple organizations such as the CDC and they don't have them.

Covid"" is blamed for escalating sickness/death in caused by vaccinations. Mainstream censure, lie, stonewall and cover up. Mass psychosis and deception rule. Many symptoms of covid/vaccines are identical to venom poisoning and treatment for such is effective. See the Italian study ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Med-scientists find venomous ""organoids"" in undiluted vaccines. The ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the vaccines cause breakdown of organs and immune system (cf ADE) – thus emergent chronic illness - “long covid” - fatigue, infertility, miscarriages (data - 75% of pregnancies) cancers, diabetes, heart damage, blood clotting, white string (metallic) clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., death - sudden in adults and children. Med-scientists have discovered toxic metals including graphene oxide in every vaccine - cf hydrogel nano technology; https://www.bitchute.com/video/OILW74CXzdjO/ . Mrna nano particles vaccine delivery cause permanent systemic organ damage and dna alteration. Covid a virus? Many high level Dr’s (cf. Dr Mike Yeadon) now state there are no respiratory viruses - viruses non existant. Synthetic venom is transmitted via physical contact, water, air & vaccine spike protein. Vaccines, masks, mandates and bogus pcr tests drive ""covid"". There is strong med-science agreement that Covid and vaccination are bioweapons. Vaccines cause the body to be a venomated spike protein factory. The more vaxx shots the more toxic spike protein invades - shed to the unvaccinated via breath and physical contact – may be eliminated by a healthy immune system - see immune system boost supplements protocols - FLCCC, Dr Ardis (cf nicotine), Dr Zelenko, Dr Love and ors – (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water). Read the Bible about eternal life.
Sars, Covi2,There's absolutely NO hope for those who will continue to get boosted. It doesn't matter how many research papers, testimonies, etc. you show them as they don't seem to possess any reasoning any more. Just let them have them and save your energy in saving those who can be saved. Those states and provinces that have the highest vax rate will continue to do what they HAD been doing, and those of us who had doubted this from the start will continue to resist it.
FDA and CDC need to be disbanded
Yes, new proof out of Germany: https://rumble.com/v1jodlh-toxic-substances-found-in-covid-vaccines-without-exception-new-german-study.html
Help us stop mandates and stop the shots: https://www.fastestlabs.com/glendale/other-testing-services/specialty-testing/
the CDC,NIH,,& the FDA are continually rejecting any facts that any World Class Medical experts present to us. So shut up peasants, & get your periodical boosters.
Covid vaccines, viruses, mrna and spike protein discussion MAY now be obsolete.HIGH level med-scientists/doctors (incl Dr Wagh Phdx2 - virology and immunology, Dr Yeadon, Dr Merritt, Dr Cahill & ors) state, that there are no respiratory viruses - viruses are non existent - cf Dr’s Sam & Mark Bailey & ors) . And all toxshots are chemical weapons - no virus, no mrna and no spike protein. Bogus PCR & face diapers do nothing but cause harm. ONE: Med-scientists have found a ""unique type of protein"" in synthetic venom (snake/other) in the toxshots. See Italian study: ""Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and fecal samples from Covid-19 patients"". Synthetic venom is easily dispersed in water, air, food & toxshots/boosters. TWO: Med-scientists have found much toxic heavy metals including reduced graphene oxide in every toxshot/booster no matter what brand (2300+ tested- 20+ scientists in universities/labs world wide), and along with nano hydrogel particles = systemic inflammation, organ and neurological damage- blood clotting etc. THUS: synthetic venom + toxshots graphene oxide + heavy metal toxicity (+ 5G) = emergent chronic illnesses - “long covid”, fatigue, infertility, miscarriages, cancers, diabetes, heart damage – myocarditis etc, blood clotting, string clotting, HIV, autoimmune & prion disease, neurological problems, shingles, super flu, chickenpox, monkey pox etc., immune system failure, death - sudden in adults and children. Unvaxxed get similar sicknesses by transmitting of graphene oxide through breath and skin - cf the blood of unvaxxed children living with vaxxed parents have graphene oxide assembling the in their blood (Dr Hoffe and ors). TO DETOX- immune system supplements - FLCCC, Dr Ardis, Dr Zelenko, Dr Love, Dr Merritt and ors– (cf Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine - Chlorine Dioxide for water).
Dr Horowitz is in the know as well on how to treat and prevent Covid based on the science : his protocols listed here and his severe Covid protocol is also great as a detox method: https://www.lymedisease.org/pfeiffer-preventing-covid/
Study on Glutathione and how it protects from Covid-19 - proven in 2020 and even back in 1970 on pneumonia prevention: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402141/
The FDA tried to ban glutathione from medical use in June 2022 because it's natural and it works on numerous illnesses, and of course, word is getting out that it prevents viruses. Smart doctors stopped the committee from banning it.

US and Taiwan to launch formal trade talks in fall | DW News
The United States and Taiwan have announced plans to start trade talks in the fall. Taipei says it wants to attract more US investment and join international trade blocs, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The announcement comes amid rising tensions with China. A recent visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island democracy drew sharp criticism from Beijing. Taiwan is the United States’ eighth-largest trading partner delivering semiconductors and many other technologies.

And I said, Why?He said, ""Because of the ditch sticks in Ottawa.""Now, I will never tell that joke becauseI can't repeat it, but it underlines the truth.You want a Prime Minister whoknows what they're talking about?Leslie Lewis has degrees in everythingfrom energy policy, environmental policy, businessadministration, a doctorate in law.Folks, she is the most learned person on this tourin this race, and more so than the Prime Minister.And she doesn't brag about it.She just takes what she's learned and puts it to work.And we like that about her talkabout putting things to work. Again,I don't begrudge the fact that our Prime Ministerlives in luxury and never really had to workfor it. We really worked hard for it.Here we have a woman who knows what it is tobuild a business from the start, knows what it is tohave to meet payroll for families who will go hungry ifthe business isn't successful, to get up early every morning andgo to bed late at night wanting to make that payroll.Folks, when we talk, when you hear a PrimeMinister who says that business people, especially small businesspeople, are just in it so they can hidetheir taxes? Unfortunately, we can't hide our taxes.He takes most of them.But here's a woman who's paid her taxes and paidher dues and did it the hard and honest way.Isn't that what you'd like tosee in the Prime Minister's office?Some people have even said, is she tough enough?Is she tough enough?Leslie, I think you've been running thatlaw firm for just under 20 years.I think, folks, picture this.How would you like to get up everymorning and go to work and work witha bunch of hungry lawyers every single day?That builds toughness.We've got a woman here who understands that.We also have a woman here who isa woman of faith and is not afraid,when she's asked about that faith, to speak about it.Don't you want somebody like that in Ottawa?She respects all faiths, but she also saysthat your faith should be respected, too.Ladies and gentlemen, it's officially MP Dr.Leslin Lewis. But she tells us we can call her Leslyn.Ladies and gentlemen, would you give a hand withyour help for the next Prime Minister of Canada?Dr. MP Leslyn Lewis!I had to get that offered.You'd say I wasn't tough enough, soI made sure I pulled it off.This is great.What an introduction!With an introduction like that, I don't evenneed to really say much about myself.So I'm just going to delve right into it.And I'm going to leave some time for questionsbecause I want to hear what's on your heartand I'm going to do what politicians don't do.I'm going to answer your questions.So I've been traveling around the country, and thequestion that I'm asked all the time is, whyare you going to do this again?You entered the race in 2020, andhere you are doing it again.And the truth is the reason why I enteredthe race in 2020, so many of those reasonsare still there, but now they are magnified.The fabric of our nation is being torn apart.Provinces like Alberta are still threateningto leave our great Confederation.Debt is piling up to the tuneof $1.2 trillion every single day.We pay interest payments, interestpayments of $140,000,000 a day.How many of you have watched Oprah?Do you know about Oprah?Do you remember that mean that she haswhen she gives a car to everybody?Well, I'm telling you, you owe 31,000, youowe 31,000, you owe 31,000, you owe 31,000.And all of your children havetheir share of debt of 31,000.And this is before they even enter the workforce.Think of what we have done to future generations.We have saddled future generations with debt.We need to turn things around.We need to create hope for future generations.And I believe that I'm the person thatcan restore hope and prosperity to this nation.The social divides have been sowide in the last two years.I am speaking to people, and when I hear theirstories, you can see the trauma that Canadians have endured.And the biggest manifestation of thatwas seen through the Trucker Convoy.Now, I don't know where you standon that issue, and it doesn't matter.What we saw happen is symbolicof a fracture in our democracy.I lived one block away from wherethe truckers parked in front of Parliament.And watching the news, I can tell you that thefirst day I had to walk through, I didn't knowwhat I was going to expect because the news, thecoverage was like our country was under siege.There were acts of sedition being committed.These people were.And so when I walked through, I said, no, I'm goingto stop and I'm going to listen and I'm going totalk to these Canadians because they are paying my salary.And it felt good to have asalary that someone else would pay.Usually I would say my own salary as a lawyer.So these Canadians are paying my salary andI am not going to listen to them.I said no, and I stoppedand I had conversations with them.And I believe that that was a missedopportunity on behalf of our Prime Minister.These were hardworking Canadians who werelabeled as misogynist, racist, demonized.And this is what we have done with Cancel Culture.We have erased what makes us truly Canadian.When I was growing up in this country, youwere taught to be proud of your country.You were taught that your Canadian identity issomething that is envied around the world.We were once the beacon of hope,of opportunity for everyone around the world.And now in our schools, our childrenare taught to erase their history.I'm not saying that we have a perfect country.We don't, and we've made mistakes, but we can learnfrom our mistakes and we can build on that.And if we erase our history, if we erase our heroes,we are doomed to make the same mistakes in the future.Now I'm going to talk to you alittle bit about the 2020 leadership race.Sometimes I would walk in aroom and people would laugh.At the beginning, people thought, whodoes she think she is?She's not even going to get any votes.And I said to myself, I knew thatI had a calling to enter politics.And I knew when I saw Andrew Scheerrunning from reporters because he didn't want totalk about being prolife, I said, there's arole and I'm going to enter politics.And I'm going to let everybody know I'm aperson of faith and I am pro-life.And that I can tell you courage becomes contagious.People were starting to say that's okay, evenif someone is pro-choice, we can have conversations.When I entered politics, when I ran for theleadership, it was always: that debate was over.And I would say, no.Any debate in the democracy should be open.That's what a democracy is.It's a plurality of voices.And we can each have our own opinion onsomething and still find something that we agree to.So I eventually won the popular vote.I got more votes than all of the other politicians.And I wasn't even an MP at that time.And I did that by buildingbridges, even something like pro-life.I said, what do we agree on?Do we agree that pregnancy care centers should bethere for women who make choices, that they mayfind themselves in a situation where they have anunwanted pregnancy and they may do something so compassionateis saying, I'm going to give this child upfor adoption to a loving family.When our adoptions list are so long in this country, shouldwe not be there for women who make those choices?And guess what?The majority of Canadians agree with that.So here we have some commonality.And I believe that the next leader of thiscountry should be a bridge builder, and I amthat person that can build those bridges.I think it's so important that we aspire tomake sure that our children have a future.I am running to be that hope.When I think of the fact that theaverage home in this country is $1.1 million.I think of the young people who have their future.They may never own a home because ofout of control inflation and the un-affordability of ever beingable to secure that down payment.I want to bring back hope to them.I want to make sure that when they graduate, they'renot competing with their fathers and their uncles and theiraunts for their jobs, that we have a system ofcreating wealth, that we incentivize businesses to one day takea chance again so that those small businesses who employover 80% of all Canadians will take a chance andemploy our youth and create opportunities for them.I'm here for the nurse who told me that sheworked throughout COVID without any vaccine, and she got Covid.And even she had to rent a trailer on herlawn to make sure that her family was protected.And she worked double shifts andshe slept out in that trailer.And then after the vaccines came out, they fired her.They told her that she could not have a job anymore.And she told me that when she looked inthe mirror in the evening after her shifts, shehad indentations in her face from the mask.And these are the sacrificesthat some people have made.And we have to make sure thatwhen we put policies in place, thesehealth policies are there to protect people.They're not based on political science.They're based on real science and make sure thatpeople are protected and that we do not createa system of segregation based on vaccine status.I'm here for people of faith to makethem recognize that they have a right topractice their faith, and that faith is entrenchedin our Constitution, in our Charter of Rights.I want to make sure that every parentin this room knows that they have aright to raise their children in accordance withtheir values without government interference.As I said before, I don't know where you stand onthe Trucker Convoy, but what I can tell you is thatthe coverage of it erodes our trust in the media.When we heard about acts of sedition, and lateron, we saw that only charges of mischief werelaid that undermines the trust in our institutions.When the Emergencies Act was enacted, was utilized toconfiscate people's property, to freeze bank accounts, it erodesour trust in the institution of government, and wemust work to restore that trust.I had a young woman in my riding of Haldimand-Norfolk,which for those of you who don't know,it's a rural community right beside Niagara Falls.And this young single mother had bought a truckerT-shirt for her daughter because she reallywanted one, and her bank account was frozen.She couldn't pay her bills. She had nofood. And this was a $20 T-shirt.When our government acts in such amanner, it really erodes our confidence.And I've had people report to me that they arethinking about even leaving our country, this beautiful country, becauseof the lack of trust in our democracy.We need to make sure that the nextleader rebuilds that trust in our institution.And one way of doing that is to makesure that our media is no longer an armof the Liberal government and to make sure thatour media is no longer used as a propagandatool, because that is what happens in dictatorship regimes.As you can see, I'm not your usual politician.I come from industry.I've taught at university.I've taught at Osgood Hall Law School.And I've owned my own business.So I know what it means to sign the frontof a paycheck rather than the back of a paycheck.I know what it means to create wealth.I know what it means to look at that two weekperiod and say, how am I going to make payroll?I know what it means in 2009 when therecession was coming and I had to make surethat my employees got paid before me.And I had to make sure that I use the lineof credit on my home to keep their jobs alive becauseI knew that they had families that were dependent on me,making sure that I give them a paycheck.So I know the realities of what it takesto create wealth, to create prosperity in this country.And right now, I see international pressures beingput on this country that will change theface of what we are as Canadians.It will change the face of ourmeritorious society to become a socialistnation state that Justin Trudeau envisions.I'm here to fight against that.So I made the tough decision thatI thought actually I could have both.I thought I could have my law practiceand be a politician because I trained lawyers.There were lawyers in my law firm.But as many of you know who haveor if you know somebody who is asmall business owner, your business becomes your brand.And many people, they still wanted to hear from me.They still wanted me to work on their case.And so I had to make a decision to sell myfirm and even the building that my law firm was in.I owned the units in that building and I sold it becauseI did not want to be double minded in doing this.I wanted to give every fiber of my being to savingmy country because I know that my country is in peril.My dream for Canada is that we can bringback a Canada where we could have a diversityof opinions, where we are not afraid to showthat we are people of faith or someone.If you're not of faith, that you havethe equal right to raise your children inaccordance with your values and practice your faithwhere we can have a dream of prosperingdeveloping our natural resources while protecting the environment.Every day we import over 500,000 barrels of oil a day.Yet we have the third largestaccessible oil reserves on the planet.We have the capacity to be self-sufficient During Covid,we should not have had to depend onforeign countries to send us masks and gloves.We have the capacity toproduce those products ourselves.We need to bring our supply chains home.We need to start producing more than we'reconsuming, and we need to become an independentand self sustaining and free nation.Thank you.Very good. Thank you very much. Dr. Lewis.We now want to enter asession of questions and answers.I'm sure a lot of you have burning questionson your heart that you'd like to ask Dr.Lewis, and I'm sure she'd be happy to answer them.So I know a lot of you probably have questions,so I will be moderating this Q and A.Please just raise your hand.Hopefully you'll have a chanceto get your question asked.And if you don't get a chance, then youwill have an opportunity to meet her afterwards andhopefully be able to ask her question in person.So without further Ado, we'll juststart with this individual right here.Happy two.Doctor Lewis, we're so excited you're running again.In the current world and procedures for the leadership race. As everyelectoral district will be allocated 100 points.At that stage, whichever is less.I think this change is really going to help you.Can you comment on that?Yes, that's a great question.So I'm just going to repeat the question.Every electoral district is allocated 100points or one point per vote.In the last leadership race, it didn't work like that.So if there were 5000 people in a riding and 20people in another, even if I won the riding with 5000people, I would only get 100 votes and the person whowon with 20 people would still get 100 votes.Now things will change.The 5000 member riding will get 100 votes, butthe one with 20 will only get 20 votes.So what happened is in the last leadershiprate, I won the popular vote, but Ididn't win the leadership because of that allocation.So this gentleman is right that thenew rules will benefit me more.But are you running to be the leader ofthe opposition with this attendant perks or the PM?One entails preaching to the choir, and I'm one ofthe members and a few other members are here.The other involves going out to anation waiting for the good news.Now, I believe, and I'm one of themas well, like yourself, an immigrant, I thinkthere are a lot of unreached natural Conservatives.So unless you or whoever is going to be theleader of the party reaches them and not just thechoir, and I understand you need to reach the choirto be the nominee but unless we reach them, youwill be comfortably sitting in a seat of the opposition.And this isn't perhaps the right venue, but I wouldlike to hear your plan, not your vision, not yourdream, because that's a what I'm interested in the how.And maybe that's a little too broad here,but perhaps you could touch on it. Thank you.No offense taken.It's a great question, actually, avery real and relevant question.I didn't come here for a comfortable job.I had a very comfortable, successful lifeas a lawyer with my own firm.I didn't want for anything.So this is really not somethingthat I'm doing for comfort.Absolutely not.And I am prepared to do what ittakes to be the next Prime Minister.And what you have stated isexactly what needs to be done.We do not need a leader tobe in Parliament and make fancy speechesand watch themselves afterwards on question period.No, we need a leader to go into the grassroots, togo into those large urban centers that we have not madeinroads in to reach out to people like yourself.Like myself, like many people in this roomwhose families immigrated here, who took chances, whotook risks, and who have those conservative values,they have faith values, they have family values.And our party has not done a good enoughjob in reaching those individuals in those urban centers.I'm going to be out talking to those people, meetingthem, having coffees, knocking on doors, and making sure thatwe make inroads in those centers that will win itand will make me the next Prime Minister.Hi.Thank you for coming.I'm just like the previous guy.I'm immigrant and coming to this countryand really enjoy the liberty that Ienjoyed the past eight years here.I'm also voted conservative all theway until the last election.I reside in the Langley area, and the MP was...I can't remember her name.The reason was that.Sorry about it.I have to tell you that in the lastelection I didn't vote for you. Yeah.You lost about a thousand votes, and oneof them who mo from Conservative to PPC.I'm a member of PPC as well.And one of the reason I'm here, I just want tosee how the next leader of the conservative can win usback, because I think that is a big part.And another reason I'm asking this question is that inthe Truck Convoy, one of the things they ask is aplatform to debate the vaccine and everything about this pandemic.I want to ask a question.Is that when you have a chance, can you providethis platform so the science can be openly debated?Absolutely. Great question.To be honest with you, Maxime Bernie is a friendof mine, and we have a lot in common.So I don't have anything bad to say about him.I do find him to be a courageous person.And I have spoken out againstunfair mandates from the very beginning.I'm one of the few in the party that reallytook the chance, and I paid a price for it.I wasn't given a shadow cabinet position, and itwas largely because of the things that I saw.And one specific thing is when theywere contemplating vaccinating six year olds, andI believe that's a parental choice.And I think that they were talking aboutmake it mandatory to go to school.And I said, you know, with allWith all due respect, I believe in science.I respect science, but this is a parental decision.And I came out and I spoke out against that.And because of that, people were upset with me.And it was a very courageous thing to do.And I've always believed in the fact that any kindof procedure that you endure and that you take intoyour body, it should be a free volition.It should be free choice to do that.Science requires debates, thesis, synthesis, antithesis.That's the scientific the dialectic order.Without that, it is propaganda. it is dictatorship.It is not science.And so when we do not have anopen debate for science, that is problematic.I believe that all the data should be there.All of the information about the vaccines, everythingshould be open so that people can makea free and informed consent about their decisions.And that's what I stand for.Leslyn, I really appreciate what you've been saying.I've been a fan of yours for a long time.There's a couple of issues.Even though everything you said is reallyimportant, there's a couple of issues thatI think perhaps are more important.And I'm very concerned about.And I'm sorry, I don't remember the exactnumber, but the bill to sort of putcontrol on the Internet, I think it's Bill C-11.C-11. Okay.That really troubles me because really it looks well, Ispent a lot of time studying this, and there's alot of people that seem to think that it's reallya way of controlling us and taking away our freedoms.The other one I'm really concernedabout is the vaccine passport.The vaccine mandates have been takenaway, but the passport hasn't.And again, the passport.The end of that, as I'm sure you probably know, isreally control to be able to know where we're going, whatwe do, and they're not going to let that go.There's going to be a real battle there.I'd like to hear your thoughts on those two things. Yes.So the first issue remind me what the first issue was.Vaccine passport. C-11. Great.So, C-11.Have you seen my speech on C eleven?I did a speech in Parliament on C-11.And I concur with everything that you're saying.When the government tells us what we can seein the media, it is a form of control.When you are punching in algorithms you're punchingin search engine search codes and words andalgorithms are popping up that the government dictateswhat you can see, what pops up.That is a form of control.And that is not freedom of the press.Even your Charter Rights, freedom of speech, which isentrenched in the Charter, freedom of association, all ofthose things, they're controlling what you can see.And it's very, very dangerous.I do not support Bill C-11.With respect to the vaccine mandate,I always use the example: sitting in this room,we don't know who's vaccinated and who's not vaccinated, but ifwe went to an airport, the same group of people, somewould be able to get on a plane and some wouldnot be able to get on a plane.And so it is not based on science.It's based on political science.And we cannot have public policy that's basedon political science and not science. Passports.You're absolutely right, because that's tied intothey at some point in time willbe advancing a universal identity. Right?And that is tied into the digitalidentity and even the universal basic income.It is something that once you have young, ablebodied people that are sitting at home and collectinga universal basic income, it's going to be alot easier to control what they do.And all of this is tied in together.I can't stand here and deny what you'resaying is not true, because it is true.The only way that we can oppose all of thismovement towards this global system is by making sure thatyou vote for the next leader, making sure that thatnext leader has the capacity to win a majority governmentso that we can turn things around.Hi. Okay.My question is also about the vaccination.Also, I'm again, I'm from South America.They try the three kind of vaccinations,like Johnson Moderna, and whatever.My country is to be the most country being vaccinated.And my question is that now, I don't agreewith that because it's like Africa and Chile.There are those two countries that are most importantand they are doing big clients in them.Like part of my family.They are already having tside effects of the vaccinations.Some of them.My grandma passed away from that vaccination.My cousin, she's three years old andshe was isolated when she was ill with vaccinesAnd now, like I heard, like they wantto give the vaccine to kids in school.Like, I'm panicking because it's likeyou say, we have freedom.We decide if they have to run or not.Well, I believe in personal responsibility.So I think it's important for peopleto do what they need to doto protect themselves, to protect their neighbors.That's a personal responsibility issue.With respect to the child vaccinations, Idon't believe they're going to be mandatory.There are a lot of people who believe thatthat should be a choice of the parents.And so you'll have a lot of support in that.But as I said, with respect to whetheror not you're vaccinated, I believe it shouldbe based on full and informed consent.The second question is, I don't knowif you got to be aware.This situation happened in 1918, 100 years agoabout the Spanish Flu. What happened at that time?the technology was not like now. People were panicking.at that time, but they say 100 year.And what happens now, 2019 again, when another pandemicis to control and to get rid of people.That's what they were trying to doin the world, in the whole world.Well, let's hope that we get through it.It's been a very traumatizing two years, and I think thatwe have to be on a path to healing and to hope.I'm a social conservative, and you are, and I reallyappreciate what you're bringing to this leadership race.You have my vote. Thank you.But I know a lot of other social conservativeswho are considering voting for Pierre Polliever because theyfeel he is more electable in the general population.So my question for you is, whatwould you say to that person?And maybe you can give me a couple ofreasons why you are more electable than Pierre.Thank you.I ask this as your supporter. Thank you.Thank you so much.Well, I remember speaking to Pierre before I decidedto put my name in, and I said tohim, I just want to hear about your platform.And he was great on thefinancing aspect, on other issues.He just didn't have a lotof concern about those issues.And I feel that in order for us to winand in order for us to keep our conservative familytogether, we're going to have to appeal to the fiscalconservatives, the social conservatives, the libertarians, and the PCs.Everybody has to have a voice within the party.And based on what I've seen and Pierre isa good man, but he believes that in orderto win, you cannot be a social conservative.I want to prove him wrong.I believe you can win as a social conservative.No only that, we have different life experiences.Pierre has been in Parliament his entire life.I have a history of working myway up, building a business, creating wealth,employing people, teaching at University.I have a diverse education.I have a master's of environmentalstudies, a PhD in international law.And I only say these things so thatyou can understand the wealth of experience andeducation that I will bring to this role.I have had people come up to me and sayI'm pro-choice, and I can't believe that I canidentify with you even though you say you're pro-life.And that is because I start fromthe perspective of building bridges and uniting.If you notice the differences in our campaignstyle, you've never heard me speak ill ofany of my colleagues in this race.It is one thing for a conservative to votefor you, but it's another thing to be ableto go in the urban centers to speak toLiberals who like my parents, my parents were ultraconservative in their values, but they voted Liberal.And that is the reality.There are many Liberals who have conservative values.What you have to ask yourself about electability, do yousee that Liberal person voting for Pierre, or do yousee that Liberal person voting for someone like me whois a unifier and a bridge builder and who hasthe education and the experience that can elicit that levelof confidence in that person?One of the aspects of your plank, if Ican call it that, really interested me when Ifirst heard of you, was your climate expertise.Now this is a major issue for the population,for the world internationally, particularly bearing in mind theUnited Nations report that came out just last yearon the impact of climate change.Now we're recognizing through the Ukraine war theabsolute present need yet of fossil fuels.We have a lot of it.You've talked about it. We know it.We know where it is.We're not using it because we're holding offbecause of the climate ideology that is outthere saying we cannot use it.How can you bridge that gap, which to meis one of the major hurdles between the peoplenot only in this country, but throughout the world?Well, I think it's very important that wespeak about the climate and the environment ina manner that it's truthful and not justfrom the state of virtue signaling and propaganda.Because of my master's in environmental studies,I actually have concrete facts and information.Much of our policy is based on hypocrisy.If we are importing 500,000 barrels of oila day, then that means that we stillhave the need to use that resource.If we have the need to use that resource,why is our resource less than a foreign resource?That's the question that we have to ask.Why is our oil inferior?Why do we have legislationto penalize companies in Canada? Bill C.48, Bill C.69 actually favors foreign oil andforeign investment over our own.It's illogical.It doesn't make any sense.And if we actually care about the environment and ifwe're not using fear, because this is what I'm seeing,is that our environmental policy is based on conjuring upfear so that we can impose unjust taxation on people.And that falls on the back of the least ableto afford it falls on the back on the averageCanadian who has to go to the pump and pumpgas, who has to heat their homes.And this is not a sustainable environmental policy.A sustainable environmental policy will haveconfidence in businesses to incentivize themto find innovative solutions.Many of these businesses, they willdiscover technologies that will reduce emissions.Many of our farmers are planting crops thatsequester carbon, but they don't get credit forit, but yet they still have to payan increase carbon tax on drying their crops.That cost trickles down to us in food costs.So a lot of what we're doing doesn't make sense.Many of the regimes, many of thejurisdictions that have the highest carbon taxhave not seen reduced emissions.Donald Trump came out of the Paris Accord, completelycame out of the Paris Accord and met allof the targets, all of the environmental climate targets.We were in the Paris accord, andwe did not meet our targets.So a lot of this is virtue signaling.I think the environment is far too important toplay partisan politics and to virtue signal and tonot have strong concrete policies that allow us todevelop our natural resources while protecting the environment.Thank you, Dr.Lewis, for your answers.I've been a pastor in the region for 24 years closer.Okay.I know there's a lot of pastors. Okay. Yeah.As you're aware, many of the rumor where there's beenabout four or five pastors arrested in the last yearand a half, two years now we have legislation criminalizingour beliefs and hindering actually making criminal our faith andwhat we believe, what we stand for, telling us whowe can actually talk to and who we can't talkto and what we can share and what we can'tshare with our congregations and with people of faith.How would you respond to the new legislation?C-4 and these things that arereally making a big impact on thefaith community, but in particular Christians? Yes.First, I want to say that with C-4,as legislators, I think our job is tomake sure that the best law is passed.And we did not do that, because what youneed to do is you actually should take thelaw through every level, every step to make surethat whether you're for the piece of legislation oryou're against it, to me is irrelevant.What we need to do, what we're elected to do,what we're paid to do, is scrutinize that legislation andto make sure that when it's enacted, it is thebest law and we did not do that.And for that, I offer my apologies to that.There's a whole process of what transpired.I don't want to go into it right now, butwhat I can do is look to the future.I have been communicating with pastors.I've had conversations with Stockwell Bay about this, who introducedme, and that was one of the first things thathe spoke to me about to clarify what happened andhow we're going to make sure that pastors are nottargeted and also to make sure that parents don't facea five year jail term if they have conversations, lovingconversations with their children.We have to remember that adolescence is one of thetoughest times for children and the hallmark one of themost important things to a parent is to be ableto usher their children through to that stage of adulthood.And they do not need any deterrence on them.They do not need a law hanging over themthat could really bind their hands to the pointwhere they are walking on eggshells and making surethat they're there for their children and they're offeringthem loving advice to assist them with their problems.So I will let you know that I amcommitted to making sure that there are no inadvertentconsequences and unintended consequences from C-4.And I will work with Pastors to makesure that this law does not limit theirability to pasture over their flock.Hi, Leslyn, it's good to be here and hear you speak.My question is about the CBC and the media.Should you win the leadership of the party,Rosemary Barton and friends will try to torrentfeather you, will misrepresent, you, will lie aboutyou, as will most of the mainstream media.So my question to you is one,how will you deal with that?And secondly, will you dare to speak toRebel Media or will you run away?Well, I think history answers that question.There was some sort of lock between our partyspeaking to Rebel a few years ago and lastyear in 2020 when I ran for the leader.To be honest with you, Ezra was theperson who came out first for me.And that's where I did myvery first interview on Rebel Media.And surprisingly, like I said, courage is contagious.After that, other Conservatives started todo interviews with Rebel Media.So Rebel Media has actually been a friend to me.Rebel Media had the courage to feature me whenI was not known in the conservative circles.And I credit that to one of the reasonswhy I was able to get myself out thereand known and with the popular vote.So, yes, I would continue speaking withRebel Media because they're my friends.And with respect to the CBC, you're right.We're giving them $1 billion a year.And it's not just the CBC.A lot of legacy media is adopting thispropaganda narrative and not really covering the news.They're giving their opinions on certain issues.And it's always a radical left opinion.And so, yes, I would defund it.I would defund the CBC.Yes, Dr.Lewis, it is a delight to have hearany politician speak as candidly as you do.I'm a semi retired professor of political science.There's a question and a suggestion.The question is this.As you know, in Canada, thefederal government has responsibility for canals,Railways, pipelines that are interprovincial.We do not have a pipeline to EasternCanada because the Quebec government didn't like it.That's one reason we cannot nowsupply oil and gas to Europe.So I'd like you to comment on that.Would you be willing to use the federalpower and then I have a suggestion.You probably have many slogans.I'll give you another: Trudeau must go.I agree with you.Yes.So I think that we must always look to actin the best interest of our national growth and prosperity.And so if it came down to it, yes, I would dowhatever it takes to make sure that I put my country first.And that includes building the pipeline.But we also have another route.We could actually go up through Churchillto Hudson's Bay, and we could getour products to tide water that way.So that's another option instead of goingthrough Quebec that we could entertain.Dr.Lewis, thank you for coming.And good to hear everything.And I would just like tosay that I'm also an immigrant.We are all immigrants to Canada.And the thing about that is itwasn't me, it was my parents.But we all came for a new chance at prosperity.And that's why we love this country,at least the country, before 2015.What I'd like to know is, if you become leaderand will you push for free votes in Parliament?Because MPs represent their community, in theircommunity, let's say chilliwack or Abbotsford.Those people were put them in that officeand they cannot speak what their constituentswant because of the party whipping.If they would just get rid of thewhip except for financial or fiscal reasons, thenthey could speak their mind and say whattheir constituents actually voted them in for locally.Absolutely.That is the cornerstone of our democracy.No MPs should have to voteagainst their conscience or their constituents.And so, as you said, on politics, forfiscal issues, you vote with your party.But on issues of conscience, therewould be absolutely free votes.And even some fiscal issues are borderlinebecause the carbon tax is something thatcould be deemed a fiscal issue.And I can tell you that in mywriting where it's a rural riding with farmers.If I voted for the carbon tax, theywould make sure I am out of there.So that would be voting against my constituents.And even though it's a fiscal issue, Iwouldn't have been able to do it.Very good.So unfortunately, we do have to wrap itup there because we do want to leave.Sometimes you'll be able to ask her in person.So we want to leave some time for people to beable to meet her in person and take pictures with her.I will be playing a job of badcop just because generally people swarm her.So we'll try to cycle peoplethrough as fast as possible.But before we do so, I do want to make apitch and encourage everyone here to get a conservative membership.You can do that by scanning this IQ code.They're both becoming a member anddonating tours are very expensive.Running a leadership campaign is very expensive.And there's a lot of people here.I'm sure some of you have someextra dollars there to help Dr.Lewis become the next Prime Minister.And with regards to membership, it was told to merecently that it's 0.02% of Canada's population that determines whothe leader of a party is and it will logicallyfollow who will be the next Prime Minister.So there's a lot of people in this room,probably close to 600 people, probably not quite 0.02%of Canada's population, but probably quite close.So if you like what you hear today from Dr.Lewis and I think you have and it soundslike you're very concerned with the state of ourcountry as well and you want to affect change.This is the one place you can get involved in politics.You can make a difference.You can go home tonight, sign up five of your friendsand family, and we can get this person as leader ofthe conservative party who can clean up the mess there andthen clean up the mess that is our nation right now.So please do your part.Please become a member.We have some lovely people at the back who wouldbe happy to sign you up, but you can alsodo that just by getting this QR code.You only need to be 14 years of ageto be able to become a member and youonly need to be a permanent resident.So I see some Gray hairs here.You probably have lots of grandchildren as well.So we really have an opportunity here to change the directionof our nation and we all know we need it.Please do that.And with regards to donations, once again,the maximum you can donate is.1675 and once again, I would be lying ifI would not like each of you to donateMax so that we can win this thing.So thank you very much.And please take a moment tocome introduce yourself to Dr. Lewis.But like I said, keep itquick, get your photo and then get out. Thank you.

JEAN-PIERRE: Hello. Good afternoon. Okay. As I’m sure you all have seen, there has been a few important foreign policy announcements over the last couple of days. And so, we were unable to have a full briefing yesterday, and I wanted to make sure you all had an opportunity to ask some questions on all of our foreign policy news.
So, today, we’re happy to have here, join me at the podium, Mr. John Kirby — Admiral Kirby. he likes to call me “Ma’am,” so I call him “Kirby.” I’m sure he’ll call you guys “sir” and “ma’ams” as well.
He is the — as you all know, the National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications. Not only does he have an extensive military background, but he also has experience at the State Department.
And he is happy to take a few questions. Kirby, I’m going to leave you to it.
MR. KIRBY: Thank you. Hey, everybody.
Q Good to see you.
MR. KIRBY: Pardon me?
Q Good to see you.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah, you too. (Laughs.)
Listen, just a — just a note off the top. I think you saw the statement, but I think it’s worth reiterating: The President had a very good call today with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.
It was an opportunity for President Zelenskyy to update President Biden on what’s going on on the battlefield and on the ground, and to talk to the President about Ukraine’s security requirements and capabilities going forward.
The President also, obviously, took this opportunity to inform President Zelenskyy that we’re announcing today, I think you saw, a billion dollars in additional security assistance to support Ukraine’s armed forces in their brave defense of their country.
Now, that includes a drawdown of security assistance valued up to $350 million — that’s where the Department of Defense pulls from their stocks; as well as $650 million in equipment that’s provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds — that’s where the Pentagon will go out and procure material according — in that amount to then just provide directly to Ukraine. So, there are two different buckets of that billion dollars.
Now, this is the 12th time that President Biden has authorized presidential drawdowns to help Ukraine defend its democracy. And that brings the total amount of security assistance that we’ve provided to Ukraine to approximately $5.6 billion just since Russia launched its assault in late February, and then approximately $6.3 billion since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration.
The President also informed President Zelenskyy that the United States is going to send an additional $225 million in lifesaving humanitarian assistance to help people inside Ukraine obtain safe drinking water, critical medical supplies, healthcare, food, shelter, and all kinds of other essential items.
I think you all realize the scope of the numbers of internally displaced people just inside Ukraine, let alone the millions that have had to leave Ukraine.
So, since February 24th, the United States has now, then, provided more than $914 million in humanitarian assistance to address the needs of people in Ukraine and for those who have had to flee. So, that’s almost a billion dollars just in humanitarian assistance.
And with that —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Ready?
MR. KIRBY: I’m ready.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Who had a question?
Go ahead.
Q Thank you, sir.
MR. KIRBY: You bet.
Q My question is more about the temperature in Europe surrounding as you guys are continuing to crank up aid. But today, President Macron said that, at some point, Ukraine’s President will have to negotiate with Russia. And that seems quite different from what President Biden and many administration officials — including, I think, you — have said about the need of stressing not telling the Ukrainians what to do. Would the administration prefer the French and also other Europeans to sort of dial down the nudging?
MR. KIRBY: Well, I think we’ll let other foreign leaders speak for themselves and — and for their countries and for their national interests. I think that’s appropriate.
But nothing has changed about President Biden’s view here — is that “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and that Ukraine is a sovereign country. President Zelenskyy is the democratically elected leader of that country, and he gets to determine how this war ends. He gets to determine how he defines victory and how he gets at that outcome.
Q Okay, just real quick, another small associated Russia question. Navalny confirmed today on Telegram that he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Vladimir, I believe. Have you guys been able to confirm that?
And second, is there any sort of response to the Russians moving him into even stricter confines?
MR. KIRBY: Yeah, well, we’re not — I don’t think we’re in a position to absolutely confirm the reports. Certainly, we’re also in no position to refute them at this time. Obviously, Mr. Navalny is speaking for himself.
But I will tell you, we continue to reiterate our demand for his immediate and unconditional release from — from being imprisoned over spurious charges after a sham trial. And the Russian — Russian authorities ought to immediately end their harassment and intimidation against him and his supporters and, again, continue to call for his immediate and unconditional release.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Peter.
Q I had a question about U.S. national security. How is it that you guys have determined that it’s in the U.S. national security interest to ask Saudi Arabia to drill more oil instead of just letting oil companies drill more here in the U.S.?
MR. KIRBY: Well, I think you know, Peter, there’s some 9,000 unused drilling permits here in the United States as well.
Look, the oil production issue is a global issue. And OPEC+3 has already increased preset increases by more than 50 percent just for July and August. And we’re grateful to Saudi Arabia’s leadership on that. But we’ve never said that — we’ve never said it’s a national security interest that somebody has to pump more oil.
And again, there’s — there’s unused permits here in the United States.
Q And — but as a national strategic issue then, how is it in the — how much lower can we let the Strategic Petroleum Reserves get before that becomes a problem?
MR. KIRBY: I think I would refer to the President’s energy advisors on something like that, Peter. I don’t — I don’t know what the inventory is. But I do, you know, remind — and I think you know this — the President did tap into the Strategic Oil Reserves to try to relieve some of the pressure at the pump, and he’ll use a range of tools available to him going forward.
I think that’s about the best I can do on that.
Q Thanks, Karine. I have a Saudi question. But first, can you comment, or what does the White House have to say, about these two Americans that have been captured that were fighting alongside Ukrainian forces? They’re missing. They are feared captured by the Russians.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah, I can’t confirm the reports, Kaitlan. Just was made aware of them before I came out here. We’ll do the best we can to monitor this and see what we can learn about it. And — well, without getting into a hypothetical, obviously, if it’s true, we’ll do everything we can to get them safely back home.
I do think, however, that this is an important point in time to remind that we discourage Americans from going to Ukraine and fighting in Ukraine. It is a war zone. It is — it’s combat. And if you feel passionate about supporting Ukraine, there’s any number of other ways to do that that are safer and just as effective.
I — we just — Ukraine is not the place for Americans to be traveling.
Q And has the President been made aware of these reports?
MR. KIRBY: I’m not aware that the President has been made aware of it. I mean, it just — it just broke — broke. So, I don’t know.
Q And my question on Saudi Arabia: Why not have the President go there and just not meet with the Crown Prince?
MR. KIRBY: The President is going to Saudi for the GCC — the GCC+3, to be honest. It’s nine states in the region. There’s a big agenda there, Kaitlan, on the Gulf Cooperation Council. It’s counterterrorism. It’s climate change. Certainly, it’s — oil production, obviously, is going to be on the agenda.
And — and a big item on the agenda is the war in Yemen. We got a ceasefire now that’s been in place for two months, got extended another two. That’s a big deal. That’s thousands of lives now in Yemen. So —
Q I understand there’s a lot to talk about. But why — if the President won’t even speak to the Crown Prince on the phone, why would he go and meet with him in person?
MR. KIRBY: Well, I was kind of getting there. So, in addition to the GCC meeting, there’ll be a series of bilateral discussions, as there are on the sidelines of all cooperation councils and summits.
He will have a bilateral meeting with King Salman and King Salman’s leadership team. And the Crown Prince is on that leadership team, so you can expect that he will see the Crown Prince while he’s there.
Q But he could ask for the Crown Prince not to be in the room, given the CIA has concluded he authorized the murder of a reporter that lived in Virginia.
MR. KIRBY: He’s going to have a series of bilateral discussions with the kings — the King and his leadership team. The Crown Prince is the Defense Minister of Saudi Arabia, and one would expect that he would need to be in the room for those meetings.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.
Q Trevor Hunnicutt, from Reuters. Just wanted to close the loop first on the meeting that President Biden had with Bolsonaro of Brazil last week.
There has been some reporting that suggested that Biden told Bolsonaro that he would reexamine steel tariffs — Brazilian steel tariffs — and that Bolsonaro asked him for support in the October election against Lula. Are either of those things true?
MR. KIRBY: Yeah, I think we gave a pretty fulsome readout of that meeting when — the trip that Karine — Karine was on. I don’t have anything more to add than what was in the readout.
Q (Inaudible) about those two issues, but not —
MR. KIRBY: Yeah, I’m not going to go beyond the readout.
Q And then, on China tariffs, we know that that’s something that the President is looking at. Could you talk a little bit about, one, the scope of the tariffs that he is looking at and if you expect that that will be finalized by, say, the end of July?
MR. KIRBY: I would just go so far as to say is the — the President wants to make sure that if we have tariffs in place, that they’re serving our interests and the interests of the American people. And — and he wants to make sure that as he reviews the — a tariff regime, that it’s — that it’s meeting those needs. And I think he’s going to keep his mind open, but I don’t have any more detail than that.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’ll take some in the back. Go ahead.
Q Thanks very much. Two quick questions, please. One on — following the latest Xi-Putin call, where apparently Xi was talking about expanding cooperation with the Russians, has — has there been any sign so far and do you see any sign coming that China is actually helping Russia militarily in any shape or form?
MR. KIRBY: No. We haven’t seen any indication that there’s been specific military assistance provided by China to Russia.
Q Thank you.
And the other question: Could you give a little bit more on the President’s comments yesterday about these grain silos being — the plans to build grain silos on the borders of Ukraine? What’s the timescale of that? And what’s the scale of that? And how much difference would it make?
MR. KIRBY: Yeah. Look, I think we’re working real hard –not just with the leadership in Ukraine, but in the region — to try to relieve the pressure that has resulted from Mr. Putin literally weaponizing food.
And so, the President is looking at a range of options here to — to try to see if we can get grain out and into the market. And that’s a — that’s tricky business. That’s not going to be easy. I mean, he’s essentially got a blockade in the Black Sea where it’s not going out by — by sea. So that doesn’t leave you a whole lot of other options. And we’re working through — with the international community to do that.
I don’t have any additional information on options about temporary silos, but I can tell you that, again, the President is keeping an open mind here. He wants to do everything he can to try to get that grain to market.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Nadia. Nadia.
Q Thank you. Hi, John. Despite your — going back to Ukraine — despite your announcement today of the military aid to Ukraine, it seems that Europe is divided between two camps. They call it the “peace camp,” led by France and Germany, Italy; and the “justice camp,” led by Poland and others, which is — basically, some wants Ukraine to negotiate and others want them to continue fighting.
Where does the United States stands? And the fact that you keep supplying them with weapons, does that mean that you are with Poland and the Baltic States and others?
MR. KIRBY: Look, the President is on the side of the people of Ukraine, and he wants to make sure that — that we’re doing everything we can to help Ukraine’s armed forces succeed on the battlefield and to give them — if and when this gets to a negotiation — that they have the leverage and the position they need in that.
But ultimately, Nadia, that’s going to be up to Mr. Zelenskyy to determine. He is the democratically elected leader of a sovereign state, and their sovereignty is what’s at risk right now. And he wants to make sure that that sovereignty is preserved, that they — that they get to decide what that looks like here.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.
Q I wanted to ask you about this, sort of, ongoing question of an investigation around the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Al Jazeera journalist and U.S. citizen.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q I know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that he would look for an independent investigation. And I was wondering if you all could explain what type of investigation this administration wants. I know a number of news outlets — Washington Post, CNN, AP — have come out for new investigations. And then also, we’ve seen Mitt Romney and I believe it was Jon Ossoff write a letter to the administration calling for an investigation. So what type of investigation would you want? What does an independent investigation look like?
MR. KIRBY: What — what we want is, obviously, for this to be fully investigated and if there needs to be accountability had, accountability had at the end of that investigation.
We’ve called for thorough, complete, transparent investigations into her death. And we’re going to be watching this very, very closely. I don’t have any additional details on what an independent investigation would look like.
Q (Inaudible.)
MR. KIRBY: I just don’t have that for you today. But I don’t want you to walk away thinking that we don’t want this fully investigated and for that investigation to be thorough and transparent.
Q Is this something the President intends to discuss on his trip? I mean, he is going to two countries, as Kaitlan mentioned, where journalists have recently been killed and there has been a lot of public outcry. And I know you all talk a lot here about press freedoms — and I’m sure we all appreciate it — but I’m just curious how that’s going to come up both in Israel and Saudi Arabia.
MR. KIRBY: It means a lot to President Biden — press freedom. And I won’t get ahead of the President’s specific discussions on this trip. I can just tell you that — that his foreign policy is really rooted in values — values like freedom of the press; values like human rights, civil rights. And he’s not going to be bashful about raising those issues with any foreign leader anywhere in the world.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Last two. Justin[Jordan] and then Ed.
Q Thanks. I want to ask you about — Turkish President Erdoğan today said that his concerns about Sweden and Finland joining NATO have not been assuaged. So how much less optimistic are you now that accession talks might begin before this month’s summit in Madrid? And does the U.S. plan to get more directly involved to try and resolve that dispute?
MR. KIRBY: We’re still optimistic that — that these issues will be able to be worked out, and that Finland and Sweden will be able to join NATO. Now, I couldn’t give you a date certain here and a time, but I think we’re still optimistic that they’ll be able to work this out.
And we know that both countries are working directly with Turkey to try to address those concerns. And I think — we think, at this point, it’s better left to them as sovereign nations to do that.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Ed, the last question.
Q Two — two on Ukraine. And welcome to the room. Going back first to — you talked about food and how it’s being weaponized by Putin in Ukraine, and that there are U.S. officials starting to discuss how to get grain and whatnot out of —
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q — Ukraine and to the areas of the world that need it. A big area of that world that needs it also happens to be countries that will be at that conference in Saudi Arabia and OPEC-producing countries.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q Can you say any more about what’s being considered or what’s being done, potentially, to get that out and whether — or to what extent that agreement stretches regionally, beyond Ukraine and the United States being concerned about it?
MR. KIRBY: What I can say is that we’re working very hard inside the international community here to try to find solutions. And, you know, you’ve heard us talk about this quite some time, and I talked about it even from my previous perch at the — at the Pentagon. It’s difficult to do when you’re talking about a country that’s at war. I mean — and we’ve already seen the ability of the Russians to strike long-range targets all the way to the west of — in the country.
So this has to be — everybody has — everybody understands the sense of urgency here and the importance of it, but there also has to be some very careful thought put into how you’re going to do this. And you’re going to have to have international cooperation and support to do it, particularly if you’re looking at ground routes.
So, while I don’t have a specific plan to brief you today, or a set of, you know, options here, I can assure you that, again, the President is keeping an open mind. He’s working directly with his interlocutors around the world to try to find ways to get this grain to market.
We all understand how important it is. We’re all mindful of the sense of urgency here, not just from an economic perspective, but from — from a humanitarian perspective. I mean, this — this is food. This is — this is sustenance for people and their livelihoods.
So we’re working it really, really hard.
Q Potentially (inaudible) especially in North Africa and the Middle East politically (inaudible).
MR. KIRBY: I mean, well, around the world, certainly, but in the region and in North Africa.
Q One other. You mentioned all the money that’s being distributed and the — a billion more today. Does the White House currently foresee the need for Congress at some point to pass another major multi-billion-dollar aid package (inaudible)?
MR. KIRBY: You know, I don’t think we’re there yet. I mean, we’re just now beginning to spend on the $40 billion supplemental that Congress approved, and we’re grateful for that, of course.
You will see additional packages coming on — on a fairly routine basis here. And we want to meter it out so that we’re in lockstep with the Ukrainians and where they are on the battlefield and what they need in real time.
That’s why conversations like today with President Zelenskyy are so important; the contact group that Secretary Austin is hosting right now in Brussels — 50-some odd nations; also putting forward other materials for security assistance.
But you need to do it — because it’s a war and it’s active combat, and it changes from day to day, you kind of need to do it in almost real time.
So we’re going to meter these out over time to — so that we’re appropriately meeting what Ukraine needs. And right now, I just don’t think we’re at a stage where we think we need to go back for more at this time.
Q But in terms of that $40 billion, none of it has been spent yet? Or —
MR. KIRBY: Well, we just announced — we just announced that —
Q So that is part of it?
MR. KIRBY: This billion is coming right out of that.
Q That’s (inaudible) also part of (inaudible).
MR. KIRBY: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right.
Q Mr. Kirby, is the President tracking negotiation in Ethiopia? We know that more people have died there than in Ukraine.
MR. KIRBY: You know, I’m going to have to take that question, and we’ll see if we can get you a better answer. I don’t know.
Q Thanks.
Q Thanks for coming.
MR. KIRBY: Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. All right, guys. Okay, I have a couple of things for you at the top.
So, I wanted to provide you an update on our work to lower gas prices for American people. As you know, the President has taken historic actions to address Putin’s price hike at the pump. He is releasing — he is releasing a record 1 billion barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He has rallied our partners to join releasing an additional 240 million barrels of oil. He expanded access to E-15, which will lower prices at thousands of gas stations.
But oil companies need to step up too. And the President made that clear in a letter to major U.S. oil refiners today. And I have a chart behind me.
In a time of global crisis, oil companies should be doing everything they can to expand capacity and lower costs at the pump. Instead, they are charging record profits at the expense of American families. The last time the price of crude oil was $120 a barrel, the price of gas was425 cents a gallon. Today, it’s about 75 cents higher.
As you can see through the chart behind me here, that difference is a result of company’s record-high profit margins for refining oil. Profit margins have tripled — you can see it right there at the end over here — since the beginning of — of the year. So right here, as you see, diesel and gas.
They should be putting those record profits into expanding refining capacity from — back to pre-pandemic levels.
President Biden is putting a spotlight on this and calling on oil refiners to invest those records — those record profits to increase capacity so cost at the pump could come down.
He is signaling that he is prepared to use any emergency tools he has, but these companies have a responsibility to step up too. We are focused on getting to solutions.
We are also closely monitoring the extreme heat conditions impacting many Americans across the country, and the President has been briefed regularly, including today.
Federal agencies are working with state and local partners to provide clear, accessible, and timely information on extreme heat and how people can protect themselves.
We are also protecting workers, including through a new administration initiative to proactively inspect over 70 high-risk industries in areas under a heat warning or advisory.
Our team is also in contact with the Department of Interior on the horrific and catastrophic floods at Yellowstone National Park, and the President was briefed about this as well today.
We are grateful for the brave and swift work of federal and state first responders to help get people in Yellowstone National Park and in surrounding communities to safety.
We know the impacts of extreme weather are intensifying and no one is immune from climate change, as you hear us talk about for this past year and a half. That is why President Biden has made tackling climate crisis one of his top priorities.
Today as well, we are also commemorating the 10-year anniversary of DACA, which President Biden considers one of his proudest moments, accomplishments with President Obama when he was then Vice President.
President Biden shared a video messaging — message marking the anniversary. And Vice President Harris, the First Lady, and Ambassador Susan Rice are also hosting meetings with DREAMers and DACA recipients here at the White House.
In 10 years, DACA has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought here as children who only know America as their home.
DREAMers contribute to their community in ways big and small. They are on the frontlines of the pandemic. Others are job creators and entrepreneurs. Many serve in our military.
The President is committed to preserving and fortifying DACA. But as he said in his State of the Union Address, we need to “provide a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers,” and he continues to call on Congress to pass a bill that does just that. And he would be ready to sign it right away.
Finally — this is the last thing here — following today’s briefing — we know we have to gather at — for — you all have to gather at 3:45, so I’ll try and take as many questions as possible. The President will sign an executive order advancing equality for LGBTQI+ individuals, which includes historic steps to support LGBTQI+ families and children.
The E- — the EO directs federal agencies to address extreme legislative attacks, help put an end to conversion therapy, improve mental health care and prevent youth suicide, launch a new initiative to protect foster youth and prevent homelessness, and more.
These are historic actions that build on the progress we have made advancing equality of LGBTQI+ Americans and people around the world, but the federal government can and most — it can and must do more — critically by Congress passing the Equality Act.
The President will renew his call for Congress to send a bill to his desk.
And with that, Aamer, you want to take this?
Q Yes. Fed officials expect the unemployment rate will rise to 3.9 percent next year as they move to lower inflation. Does the White House think slightly higher unemployment is an acceptable trade-off to fix inflation?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I mean, here’s the reality that we’re in, and the facts are: We brought unemployment down below 4 per- — 4 percent. You’ve heard, most recently, at 3.6. Four years faster than forecasters thought was possible before we passed the American Rescue Plan, which was over a year ago, back in last April of 2021.
Part of that means a transition over the course of the next year. We have added an average of more than 400,000 jobs per month in recent months to something closer — like a cooldown, if you will — to the range of 150,000 jobs per month.
That would be consistent with the unemployment rate as low as it is now, with the 3.6. That will be a good thing and a sign of a healthy economy, and also a transition as we are going — as we are headed towards.
Let me just call people I haven’t called on yet. Go ahead.
Q Thanks, Karine. In the letter from the President to the oil refinery — the refiners, he said they need to work with the administration to bring about a near-term solution. Is there an “or else” in there from the President? Is there some way that the administration plans to try to hold these companies accountable? You used the word “responsibility” in your message at the top here.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Right. We see it as a patriotic duty, as we’re — as we are — as we’ve talked about. There’s war happening right now in Ukraine that was caused by — caused by Russia, which is why we’re seeing these hikes in gas prices. Especially since — since Russia has amassed — started amassing troops on the border, we saw a — we’ve seen a $2 increase of gas prices.
So, we know where to put the blame: on the war. But oil companies, they have — oil refineries, they have a responsibility too. What they have been doing is taking advantage of the war.
And as — as I showed earlier, they have tripled — tripled their — their income. And so, this is a problem. But what we’re trying to do — by putting out the letter, we’re saying, “Hey, we need you to act. It is time to act.” We want to have a conversation. We want to come to a solution. There is going to be a conversation later this — this week, I believe, with the Energy Department. And so that’s going to happen.
So this is basically a bit of a “Hey, we want — we want you to act. It’s time to act.” We have done our part with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — the one — the 1 million a day for the next six months, and so we need them to act.
So that’s where we are. We want to come to solutions, which is why we say we want to have that conversation. And we will see where it goes from there.
Q And is there something the President is considering to compel them or a consequence if that does not happen?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I don’t have anything right now to preview as to what would come — what would come next. But what I will say is that we are — we are calling on them to do the right thing, to be patriots here, and not to use the war as an excuse or as a — as a reason to not put — to not put out a production, not — to not do the capacity that is needed out there so that the prices can — so that the prices can come down.
Go ahead.
Q On the economy —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, I probably should have called on somebody who I haven’t called on, but go ahead.
Q Just very quickly —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Really quickly.
Q — Atlanta Fed economic forecast puts real GDP growth for the second quarter at 0.0 percent now. With the United States potentially on the knife’s edge of a ‘70s-style stagflation kind of period, I’m curious about, kind of, your policy preferences.
Do you expect that the administration will prioritize stimulus to get growth higher and curtail unemployment? Or do you think that you will — you will continue to favor deficit reduction to get inflation down?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, the President laid out in his — in his Wall Street Journal op-ed very recently what he’s doing, the points that he’s taking to make sure that we are fighting inflation, attacking inflation.
One of them is giving the Fed its independence and — and allowing them to deal with inflation under their purview. They have the best monetary policies to do that. And so we want to give that independence there.
And, of course, he has taken actions, as I said early on in in the beginning of the briefing, on things that will help ease that — ease the cost for families. We understand gas prices are high. We understand — the President understands what it means to have food prices.
Again, that’s connected to Putin’s war against Ukraine and them attacking another country’s sovereignty. That’s what we’re seeing happening there.
And so we’re going to continue to do everything that we can. We feel that we are in a transition right now from a economic — historic economic growth — recovery. And so, going into that transition with stability and steady — steady growth, we feel that’s going to help with inflation.
So, we’re going to just focus on the points that the President laid out in his — in his op-ed.
I’m going to — I’m going to move on so I can get other people.
Q It’s okay. Go back.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You sure?
Q I’m fine. Yeah.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, my gosh. Okay, I’m going to — let me get — I’m going to get you, and then I’ll start moving around so I can be done with the first row. (Laughs.)
Q Are there other industries that you think need to step up in a patriotic fashion to try to help reduce inflation or costs for Americans?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I don’t — I — there’s not a list that I have right now for you. Right now, we want to focus on the oil refinery, which is why we put out the letter today, or yesterday. I’m losing my — my track of time.
And so, we see that as an important first step in making sure that the oil refineries are doing their — their part — again, patriotic duty — in making sure that they’re putting out capacity and they’re not taking advantage of a — of a war that is hurting the American public.
And so we’re going to have — hopefully, we’re going to have — we’re going to have a conversation, we’re going to get to a solution and move this forward.
Q The President often talks about being a capitalist, and, obviously, market forces drive a lot of that. So how would he find the balance between trying to encourage them to do more without looking like he is trying to move a sector of the private industry?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, the facts are the facts, Kelly O.
We — what we have seen is they are not — their capacity is not there. And they — from the chart — they are using this moment — using this moment of war where the American — where American families are feeling — are feeling the high costs with food and gas. I mean, that is not a patriotic thing to do.
And the person — the President has the right to call them out. And so, he’s using his perch. He’s using this opportunity that he has to make sure that — he always said he’s going to use every lever that he can to make sure he’s delivering for the American people. And that’s what he’s — he’s going to try and do at this point. Thank you.
Go ahead.
Q Progressives in Congress are calling for the passage of a windfall profits tax targeting the oil and gas sector. What’s the President’s position on that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I don’t have a position for you to share — to share at this time on that.
Q When we talk to oil analysts, they say that one thing we all ought to be concerned about is the prospect of a hurricane hitting refineries on the Gulf Coast. Are you aware of any steps the administration is taking now to gird against that possibility?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have anything on a hurricane at this moment — like what we’re going to do to take steps on hurricane and oil refinery. I’m happy to check in with the team and get back to you to see if there’s a pla- — a plan in place. But I don’t have anything for you at this time.
Q One more quick thing because I know you got to go.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sure. Sure, sure.
Q The country’s refineries are aging. A major refinery really hasn’t been built in this country since the late 1970s. If one were to be proposed, would the President support the construction of a new refinery or oppose it?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That would — I have not seen any of that reporting. And that is not something that I can confirm from the podium at this time. Okay?
Do you want to go, Andrew?
Q Thanks. Let’s just try one more time on the refinery issue.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q In the letter, the President said that he’s “prepared to use all reasonable and appropriate federal government tools and emergency authorities to increase refinery capacity.” What are those tools exactly that he has?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, he is open to all reasonable uses of the federal government’s tools to increase output and lower costs at the pump, including emergency authorities like the Defense Production Act.
Already, the President has demonstrated his willingness to use that emergency powers to lower costs for families. As I’ve mentioned, the petroleum — the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — as we’re using right now to get — to get oil every day to make sure we’re — we’re doing everything we can to lower costs; the ethanol 15 — the homegrown biofuels that is going to help many, many families across the country, including in the Midwest. So, that’s a way that the President has acted.
And so, he is going to auth- — he authorized the use of DPA to accelerate domestic production of key energy technologies, as well.
And so, the letter — just to put — put in context for a second — the letter is intended to solicit companies’ best ideas on how to increase capacity and how the government can help them do it in the spirit of the earnest and pragmatic dialogue.
But we feel like this is a good step for us to move forward, and hopefully we’ll come and get some solutions.
Q So are you saying he could use the Defense Production Act to expand capacity?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, we’re — we — I don’t have anything to share specifically how we would use the DPA, but we’re saying that the President has used it before and he’s willing to do that again.
But the first — the first step that he wants to do is make sure to have the conversation and hear ideas — right? — from the oil refineries how we can be — how we can be helpful to them to actually get more capacity out.
Q If you want to take one more.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’ll take — I’ll take like two more. I’ll take two more.
Go ahead.
Q Thanks very — thanks very much. We’re just about to go into a Pride event, obviously.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q We know that Saudi officials have been seizing rainbow-colored toys and clothing as part of an apparent crackdown on homosexuality in the country there. That’s according to state-run media.
I wonder what the White House response is to that, given that the President is about to set up his Pride credentials in the next event.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I have not seen that reporting. But what I can say: Globally, we work around the globe to protect LGBTQI+ persons from violence and abuse, criminalization, discrimination, and stigma and — and empower local LGBTQI+ movements and persons.
We do this through bilateral and multilateral channels, raising official concerns with governor — governments, both principal [publicly] and privately; coordinating our efforts with likeminded countries; and offering emergency assistance to LGBTQI+ persons at risk.
Through our foreign assistance program — programming, we support civil society in providing LGBTQI+ individuals and communities with tools and resources to prevent, mitigate, and recover from violence, discrimination, and stigma.
We see human rights as being universal.
I’m going to take one last more.
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
Well, I’m going to take one last one. I’m going to take one last one.
Go — go ahead. Go ahead.
Q Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancé said today she was, quote, “very disappointed” President Biden plans to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. She said in a message to the President, quote, “If you have to put oil over principles and expediency over values, can you at least ask, ‘Where is Jamal’s body?’” and, quote, “‘What happened to his killers?’”
So will President Biden ask the Crown Prince these questions?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You know, first, I want to say — you know, just hearing that — it’s devastating, right? It is — it is Jamal Khashoggi’s widow. And so, clearly, our hearts go out to her and the pain that she’s currently going through.
You know, when it comes to human rights, this is not something — the President is a straight shooter. This is not something that he’s afraid to talk about. He has those conversations — leader-to-leader conversations on a regular basis.
I cannot read out right now or lay — or lay out what the agenda is going to be or what the conversations are going to be. But I can assure you — I can assure you that when it comes to human rights, this is something that is a priority for this President.
I just laid out how — at the end of talking about the LGBTQI+ community — how human rights is universal, and that is very, very true in — in many ways.
And so, I — once we have more to share, we’ll share more about what the trip will look like.
Okay, I have to go.
Q Karine, can I just follow on that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I got to go, guys.
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
I got to go, guys.

JEAN-PIERRE: Good afternoon, everyone. So, I’d like to welcome Matthew and Camila McConaughey to the White House today to speak on an urgent issue our nation is currently facing. You may know Matthew as an actor, but more importantly, he is a father; a native of Uvalde, Texas; and a gun own- — and a gun owner.
He is here today to use his platform to call on leaders to take bipartisan action to end this senseless killing and pass reasonable gun responsibility measures that we know will save lives.
Just a few minutes ago, Matthew met briefly with the President to talk about the importance of taking action, keeping our communities safe.
But without further ado, I would like to bring up Matthew.
MR. MCCONAUGHEY: Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Here you go.
MR. MCCONAUGHEY: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Camila.
To make the loss of these lives matter.
My wife and I — my wife and I — Camila — we spent most of last week on the ground with the families in Uvalde, Texas, and we shared stories, tears, and memories.
The common thread, independent of the anger and the confusion and sadness, it was the same: How can these families continue to honor these deaths by keeping the dreams of these children and teachers alive?
Again, how can the loss of these lives matter?
So while we honor and acknowledge the victims, we need to recognize that this time it seems that something is different. There is a sense that perhaps there is a viable path forward. Responsible parties in this debate seem to at least be committed to sitting down and having a real conversation about a new and improved path forward — a path that can bring us closer together and make us safer as a country, a path that can actually get something done this time.
Camila and I came here to share my stories from my hometown of Uvalde. I came here to take meetings with elected officials on both sides of the aisle. We came here to speak to them, to speak with them, and to urge them to speak with each other — to remind and inspire them that the American people will continue to drive forward the mission of keeping our children safe, because it’s more than our right to do so, it’s our responsibility to do so.
I’m here today in the hopes of applying what energy, reason, and passion that I have into trying to turn this moment into a reality. Because as I said, this moment is different. We are in a window of opportunity right now that we have not been in before, a window where it seems like real change — real change can happen.
Uvalde, Texas, is where I was born. It’s where my mom taught kindergarten less than a mile from Robb Elementary. Uvalde is where I learned to master a Daisy BB gun. I took that — that took two years before I graduated to a 410 shotgun. Uvalde is where I was taught to revere the power and the capability of the tool that we call a gun. Uvalde is where I learned responsible gun ownership.
And Uvalde called me on May 24th, when I learned the news of this devastating tragedy. I had been out of cellular range working in the studio all day when I emerged and messages about a mass shooting in the town I was born in began flooding my inbox.
In a bit of shock, I drove home, hugged my children a bit tighter and longer than the night before, and then the reality of what had happened that day in the town I was born in set in.
So the next morning, Camila, myself, and the kids, we loaded up the truck and drove to Uvalde. And when we arrived a few hours later, I got to tell you, even from the inside of our vehicle, you could feel the shock in the town. You could feel the pain, the denial, the disillusion, anger, blame, sadness, loss of lives, dreams halted.
We saw ministries. We saw first responders, counselors, cooks, families trying to grieve without it being on the frontpage news.
We met with the local funeral director and countless morticians who — who hadn’t slept since the massacre the day before because they’d been working 24/7 trying to handle so many bodies at once — so many little, innocent bodies who had their entire lives still yet to live.
And that is there that we met two of the grieving parents, Ryan and Jessica Ramirez. Their 10-year-old daughter, Alithia — she was one of the 19 children that were killed the day before.
Now, Alithia — her dream was to go to art school in Paris and one day share her art with the world. Ryan and Jessica were eager to share Alithia’s art with us, and said if we could share it, then somehow maybe that would make Alithia smile in heaven. They told us that showing someone else Alithia’s art would in some way keep her alive.
Now, this particular drawing is a — is a self-portrait of Alithia drawing, with her friend in heaven looking down on her drawing the very same picture. Her mother said, of this drawing — she said, “You know, we never really talked to her about heaven before, but somehow she knew.”
Alithia was 10 years old.
Her father, Ryan — this man was steady. He was uncommonly together and calm. When a frazzled friend of his came up and said, “How are you so calm? I’d be going crazy,” Ryan told him — he said, “No, you wouldn’t. No, you wouldn’t. You’d be strong for your wife and kids, because if they see you go crazy, that will not help them.”
Just a week prior, Ryan got a full-time line job stringing powerlines from pole to pole. And every day since landing that well-paying, full-time job, he reminded his daughter, Alithia — he said, “Girl, Daddy going to spoil you now.” Told her every single night. He said, “Daddy is going to take you to SeaWorld one day.
But he didn’t get to — he didn’t get to spoil his daughter, Alithia. She did not get to go to SeaWorld.
We also met Ana and Dani- — Danilo, the mom and the stepdad of nine-year-old Maite Rodriguez. And Maite wanted to be a marine biologist. She was already in contact with Corpus Christi University of A&M for her future college enrollment. Nine years old.
Maite cared for the environment so strongly that when the city asked her mother if they could release some balloons into the sky in her memory, her mom said, “Oh no, Maite wouldn’t want to litter.”
Maite wore green high-top Converse with a heart she had hand-drawn on the right toe because they represented her love of nature.
Camila has got these shoes. Can you show these shoes, please?
Wore these every day. Green Converse with a heart on the right toe. These are the same green Converse on her feet that turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting. How about that?
Maite wrote a letter. Her mom said if Maite’s letter could help someone accomplish her dream, that then her death would have an impact, and it would mean her dying had a point and wasn’t pointless — that it would make the loss of her life matter.
The letter reads: “Marine biologist. I want to pass school to get to my dream college. My dream college is in Corpus Christi, by the ocean. I need to live next to the ocean because I want to be a marine biologist. Marine biologists study animals and the water. Most of the time, I will be in a lab. Sometimes, I will be on TV.”
Then there was Ellie Garcia, a 10-year-old, and her parents, Steven and Jennifer.
Ellie loved to dance, and she loved church. She even knew how to drive tractors and was already working with her dad and her uncle mowing yards.
“Ellie was always giving of her gifts, her time, even half-eaten food on her plate,” they said. They said, “Around the house, we’d call her the ‘great re-gifter.’” Smiling through tears, her family told us how Ellie loved to embrace. Said she was the biggest hugger in the family.
Now, Ellie was born Catholic, but had been going to Baptist church with her uncle for the last couple of years. Her mom and dad were proud of her because, they said, “She was learning to love God, no matter where.”
The week prior to her passing, she had been preparing to read a verse from the Bible for the next Wednesday night’s church service. The verse was from Deuteronomy 6:5. “And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.”
That’s who Ellie was becoming. But she never got to read it. Service is on a Wednesday night.
Then there was the fairytale love story of a teacher named Irma and her husband, Joe. What a great family this was. This was an amazing family.
Camila and I, we — we sat with about 20 of their family members in the living room, along with their four kids. They were — the kids were 23, 19, 15, and 13. They — they shared all these stories about Irma and Joe — served the community and would host all these parties, and how Irma and Joe were planning on getting a food truck together when they soon retired.
They were humble, hardworking people. Irma was a teacher, who, her family said, “went above and beyond, and just couldn’t say no to any kind of teaching.” Joe had been commuting to and from work 70 miles away in Del Rio for years.
Together, they were the glue of the family. Both worked overtime to support their four kids. Irma even worked every summer when school was out. The money she had made two summers ago paid to — paid to paint the front of the house. The money she made last summer paid to paint the sides of the house. This summer’s work was going to pay to paint the back of the house.
Because Irma was one of the teachers who was gunned down in the classroom, Joe, her husband, literally died of heartache the very next day when he had a heart attack.
They never got to paint the back of the house, they never got to retire, and they never got to get that food truck together.
We also met a cosmetologist. All right? She was well versed in mortuary makeup. That’s the task of making the victims appear as peaceful and natural as possible for their open-casket viewings.
These bodies were very different. They needed much more than makeup to be presentable. They needed extensive restoration. Why? Due to the exceptionally large exit wounds of an AR-15 rifle. Most of the bodies so mutilated that only DNA tests or green Converse could identify them. Many children were left not only dead, but hollow.
So yes, counselors are going to be needed in Uvalde for a long time. Counselors are needed in all these places where these mass shooters have been for a long time.
I was told by many that it takes a good year before people even understand what to do next. And even then, when they become se- — secure enough to take the first step forward, a lifetime is not going to heal those wounds.
Again, you know what every one of these parents wanted, what they asked us for? What every parent separately expressed in their own way to Camila and me? That they want their children’s dreams to live on. That they want their children’s dreams to continue to accomplish something after they are gone. They want to make their loss of life matter.
Look, we heard from — we heard from so many people, all right? Families of the deceased — mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers. Texas Rangers, hunters, Border Patrol, and responsible gun owners who won’t give up their Second Amendment right to bear arms. And you know what they all said? “We want secure and safe schools, and we want gun laws that won’t make it so easy for the bad guys to get these damn guns.”
So, we know what’s on the table. We need to invest in mental healthcare. We need safer schools. We need to restrain sensationalized media coverage. We need to restore our family values. We need to restore our American values. And we need responsible gun ownership — responsible gun ownership.
We need background checks. We need to raise the minimum age to purchase an AR-15 rifle to 21. We need a waiting period for those rifles. We need red-flag laws and consequences for those who abuse them.
These are reasonable, practical, tactical regulations to our nation, states, communities, schools, and homes.
Responsible gun owners are fed up with the Second Amendment being abused and hijacked by some deranged individuals.
These regulations are not a step back; they’re a step forward for a civil society and — and the Second Amendment.
Look, is this a cure-all? Hell no.
But people are hurting — families are, parents are. And look, as — as divided as our country is, this gun responsibility issue is one that we agree on more than we don’t. It really is. But this should be a nonpartisan issue. This should not be a partisan issue.
There is not a Democratic or Republican value in one single act of these shooters. It’s not.
But people in power have failed to act. So we’re asking you and I’m asking you, will you please ask yourselves: Can both sides rise above? Can both sides see beyond the political problem at hand and admit that we have a life preservation problem on our hands?
Because we got a chance right now to reach for and to grasp a higher ground above our political affiliations, a chance to make a choice that does more than protect your party, a chance to make a choice that protects our country now and for the next generation.
We got to take a sober, humble, and honest look in the mirror and re- — rebrand ourselves based on what we truly value. What we truly value.
We got to get some real courage and honor our immortal obligations instead of our party affiliations.
Enough with the counterpunching. Enough of the invalidation of the other side. Let’s come to the common table that represents the American people. Find a mil- — middle ground, the place where most of us Americans live anyway, especially on this issue.
Because I promise you, America — you and me, who — we are not as divided as we’re being told we are. No.
How about we get inspired? Give ourselves just cause to revere our future again. Maybe set an example for our children, give us reason to tell them, “Hey, listen and watch these men and women. These are great American leaders right here. Hope you grow up to be like them.”
And let’s admit it: We can’t truly be leaders if we’re only living for reelection.
Let’s be knowledgeable and wise, and act on what we truly believe.
Again, we got to look in the mirror, lead with humility, and acknowledge the values that are inherent to but also above politics. We’ve got to make choices, make stands, embrace new ideas, and preserve the traditions that can create true — true progress for the next generation.
With real leadership, let’s start giving us — all of us, with real leadership — let’s start giving all of us good reason to believe that the American Dream is not an illusion.
So where do we start? We start by making the right choices on the issue that is in front of us today.
We start by making laws that save innocent lives and don’t infringe on our Second Amendment rights. We start right now by voting to pass policies that can keep us from having as many Columbines, Sandy Hooks, Parklands, Las Vegases, Buffaloes, and Uvaldes from here on.
We start by giving Alithia the chance to be spoiled by her dad.
We start by giving Maite a chance to become a marine biologist.
We start by giving Ellie a chance to read her Bible verse at the Wednesday night service.
We start by giving Irma and Joe a chance to finish painting their house, maybe retire and get that food truck.
We start by giving Makenna, Layla, Maranda, Nevaeh, Jose, Xavier, Tess, Rojelio, Eliahna, Annabell, Jackie, Uziyah, Jayce, Jailah, Eva, Amerie, and Lexi — we start by giving all of them our promise that their dreams are not going to be forgotten.
We start by making the loss of these lives matter.
Thank you. Thank you.
Q Sir, when you spoke to the President, did he say anything about this? Were you grandstanding just now, sir?
Q Are the changes that are being discussed (inaudible), Mr. McConaughey?
Q What’s your response to (inaudible)?
Q What was your message to the President, Mr. McConaughey?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. I know that the President has an event right after this. I think it’s running — it’s running a few minutes — a few minutes behind. So, I will — we’ll do the briefing until we have to — we have to move to the event.
I have a couple of things at the top, and then we’ll open it up.
As I just mentioned, soon the President will sign into law nine bipartisan bills that support veterans, and he will be joined by members of Congress from both parties, veteran advocates, and veterans who will benefit from these laws.
President Biden ran on the promise to unite the country, which is why supporting veterans is a key part of his Unity Agenda announced at the State of the Union. Supporting our country’s veterans is an issue that all Americans can agree on.
Among the impact of the bills being signed into law today are two that will improve access to breast imaging services for veterans, including those who experienced toxics — toxic exposures during military service.
Other bills to be signed include three to honor the legacy of service to our nation, including one to award a single Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Army Rangers World War II. The Rangers played a crucial role in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, which began exactly 78 years ago yesterday.
Also today, the Senate voted to advance the PACT Act. The President was clear in his State of the Union that addressing toxic exposures is a priority and Congress should move with the urgency for our veterans.
Today, Congress took a major step forward. President Biden looks forward to final passage of this legislation so that he can sign it into law and continue to uphold our sacred obligation to support those who have served our nation, their families, caregivers, and survivors.
Today, the administration announced new investments from the American Rescue Plan to help provide every American with access to affordable high-speed Internet.
These investments will bring down costs for families and small businesses, particularly in rural and remote areas, and ensure affordability.
This morning, Treasury announced the first state awards from the $10 billion Capital Projects Fund, which will make resources immediately available in Louisiana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and West Virginia to connect over 200,000 homes that currently lack access.
On a sad note, our dear friend and colleague, Michael Gwin, will be leaving us for Treasury, where he will be ser- — where he will serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Gwin has served as the White House Director of Rapid Response for the past 16 months, responding to the most challenging and difficult issues imaginable. Yet, amidst these often emotionally-wrenching stories, Gwin’s poise and moral clarity are unfailing, and his willingness and ability to step up has made him an indispensable member of the team.
And joining Gwin at the Treasury Department will be our very own Michael Kikukawa, where he will serve as a spokesperson. Michael, better known here to all of you, to all of us as “Kiku,” has served not just as a Press Assistant but as the strong engine and reliable engine at the press shop. His relentless work ethic and dedication to the mission of this team have been second to none.
Kiku and Gwin, we will miss you both. Thank you so much. Very heart-wrenching, but I’m very excited for both of you. Wishing you the best.
And we do have some “hellos.” I know we keep announcing people leaving, but we actually have people coming, backfilling — some great, great folks who are joining our team. Two new members who are here to our team.
I’d like to first introduce Abdullah Hasan right here — some of you know him already — who will be joining us as an Assistant Press Secretary, having previously served as the Deputy Associate Director for Communications for the White House Office of Management and Budget. Amongst many topics, Abdullah will be covering civil rights, immigration, and climate.
We also would like to extend a warm welcome to Alexandra LaManna — hello — who is joining us on detail from Treasury, where she has served as senior spokesperson. Part of Alexandra’s profile will be working on housing, infrastructure implementation, and other economic issues.
Abdullah and Alexandra haven’t even gotten their full-time badges yet, but we are already getting them hard at work, and we appreciate all of their work thus far. It has — we have felt the impact of it.
Okay, please join me in welcoming the team.
And with that, I think that’s all I have. All right. Go ahead. Go ahead, Zeke.
Q Thanks, Karine. I know we’re getting ready to start here kind of late, and (inaudible) briefing, I’m hoping you might be able to pick this up after the President’s event, just because we got a lot of people who have questions.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I hear you. I have other — I have other obligations as well after this, so we’ll see. We’ll see what we can do. But I can’t make any promises. But let’s — why don’t we get going?
Q Great. So, on the subject of guns, the President had a meeting with Chris Murphy, but he didn’t speak to the public today. Does the President have a clearer sense of where things are, what is possible on Capitol Hill? And also, why is he turning to a Hollywood actor to make the message — take the message to the American people? Does he feel like his voice doesn’t matter?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: His voice does matter. You heard him speak on Thursday very clearly, very loudly, very passionately during primetime at a — at a critical time during the day where he made sure that he can communicate with the American people.
And so — he’s the President of the United States. His voice carries and it does matter. What he says is — has — carries weight that is pretty tremendous.
Matthew was here because, as you heard, he has a very personal connection to Uvalde. He met with the family. He is from there. He was born there. He lives in Texas. And we thought hearing from him directly, him using his platform, is incredibly important.
We all know what it’s like or how important it is for folks — especially on — whether you are an actor, whether you are in the business sector, wherever you are — to use your platform, how critical and important it is.
And I think his words here today were incredibly powerful and emotional. And I thank him and Camila for coming here today. They met with the President, as I just mentioned. And so I just, you know, wanted to just address that, Zeke.
The President received an update, as — as you all know, as we’ve mentioned, from Senator Murphy on the state of negotiations on Capitol Hill. He told Senator Murphy he strongly support his efforts to find a compromise, and encouraged him to get the strongest possible results.
In the end, the President said that the message he took from the families from — at Uvalde, when he was there, was to do something. It was to “please do something.” That’s what the grieving family told him. Some of you heard that yourselves from the community memb- — from the community when he was in Uvalde. And so that is what Senator Murphy and his colleagues are going to do. They’re going to do just that.
Q And on a different — just on a different subject, the President is meeting with President Bolsonaro of Brazil. The AP is reporting that the Brazilian government, that President Bolsonaro wanted concessions from the President for that meeting and for his attendance at the Summit of the Americas that he wouldn’t bring up Bolsonaro’s casting doubts about Brazil’s election system as well as environmental concerns in the Amazon. Can you confirm that report?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I cannot confirm that report. The President is looking forward to leaving tomorrow to head to the summit that clearly that we’re — that we are hosting.
I can say this: The United States continues to recognize Juan Guaidó as the Interim President of Venezuela. That said, while the interim government was not invited to participate in the main summit, they are welcome to participate in all three stakeholder forums and other events.
Go ahead.
Q Is the President now getting more directly involved in the negotiations on the Hill now that he has met with Senator Murphy?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I — you know, I want to be very clear here: Senator Murphy has said this many times during interviews on various networks here that he believes it’s time for the Senate to act. And that is what they’re doing.
The President is encouraged about what he is seeing with this team of negotiators on the — on the Senate side. And he is, like I said, encouraged and wants to continue to see them move forward and take action.
Q And in the meeting with Matthew McConaughey, did — did McConaughey go through the same elements with the President that he did here at the podium?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, they had a private conversation. I’m not going to readout their private conversation.
As you can imagine, the President went to Uvalde himself. He also met — met with many of the family members. He also is — heard many of the stories that Matthew came here to — to share with all of you. So, they certainly connected on that aspect.
Q Thanks, Karine.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.
Q Is the President willing to accept whatever agreement lawmakers come to, should they come to an agreement, when it comes to guns?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, here’s — as you know, the President has been very involved in gun reform as senator, as Vice President, and, clearly, now as President, having signed the most executive actions on gun reform than any president at this time of their presidency.
And when — when he was senator, he was — he was talking about this today — it took him years. It took him years to get the 1994 assault ban — assault ban legislation. Now, that — that was law for 10 years and expired in 2004.
And so, we haven’t seen this type of — this type of negotiations or this type of coming together from both sides in a very long time. It’s been decades.
So, he is encouraged, he is optimistic about what — about what he’s seeing, about what he is hearing — the update that he received. And so, we’re going to see how those negotiations go.
And any — any step, we bel- — he believes any step is a step forward. He’s going to continue to call for all of the things that you heard him lay out, when it comes to what he sees as comprehensive gun reform, on Thursday. But he also believes that any step forward is a — is important.
Clearly, we’re not going to negotiate from here. And we’re going to leave the specifics to the senators.
Q And one other question: Does he still seek to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I spoke to this — I spoke to this yesterday. And I could share some more thoughts on that now.
But look, the President was very clear when he was asked about this on — on Friday, when he was delivering his remarks on the economy. And basically, he said, as President, he believes that if there is any — any way to get peace, he feels like he should take that — he should take that direction.
So, Saudi Arabia has been a strategic partner of the United States for eight decades. Every president since FDR has met with Saudi leaders. And the President considers Saudi Arabia an important partner on a host of regional and global strategies, including other efforts to end the war in Yemen, contain Iran, and counter terrorism.
Saudi pilots flew with ours in the war against ISIS, its navy patrols with — with ours in the Red Sea and the Gulf, and the U.S. military personnel are based in Saudi Arabia.
As I’ve said, the President will meet with any leader if it serves the interests of the American people. That’s what he puts first. He believes engagement with Saudi leaders clearly meets that test, as has every president before him.
I’m going to move around —
Q But all of those things were true —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m going to move around, Ka- — I’m going move around.
Q All of those things were true —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m going to move around. I’m going to —
AIDE: Hey, Karine. He’s about to get started.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m going to — really? Okay, I’m going to take one more.
Q All of those things were true when the President vowed to make them a pariah state. So, I’m just curious: What changed?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m going to take — I’m — I’m going to — Kaitlan, I’m going to take one more. I’m going to take one more.
Q Just, on these negotiations: If changing background checks for younger people than 21 is what ends up happening, opening these juvenile records to more scrutiny is what comes of this, does the President believe that that is meaningful change? Is that satisfying? If that’s what comes of this moment, is he okay with that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the President was clear last week that there’s real urgency and — to make sure something like Uvalde or Buffalo and many mass shootings prior can’t happen again. And we’re encouraged, again, by the progress that we’re seeing.
You know, we’re — we’re going to stay closely engaged. We’re going to not negotiate from here. We’re going to let the contours of the legislation and those conversations play out. And what we are encouraged by is that the conversation is happening, both sides are coming together. We saw the House taking some — taking some actions last week. They’re — they also will take some actions this week.
What we — what the President believes is that we have to do something. And like he said on Thursday, “Enough is enough.”
Q Is he confident there’ll be a deal by the end of the week?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I can’t speak to the timeline. That is it going to be up to Senator Schumer and — and Chris Murphy and their conversations that we’re having.
(The press briefing stops for the presidential bill signing.)
(The press briefing resumes.)
Q Welcome back.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I am — I am back by popular demand.
Q Appreciate it. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, absolutely. I’m — and look, I just want to be very clear here — you know, sorry about that. There are times where briefings get delayed for reasons outside of our control, and we wanted to make sure you all had the opportunity to cover the President signing those bills for — to support veterans, which is incredibly important, as you all know.
And so, taking your questions is very important to us and — which is why we do it almost every day and — when we can. And it’s why we strive to be responsive to your questions here in the briefing room; on TV, as I did this morning; and in individual conversations with administration officials. And our team does this on a daily basis.
So, with that, I wanted to just come in and take additional questions for a few more minutes. And, you know, I know a lot — a lot of you have deadlines yourselves and have to do evening TV. So I won’t be here for too long, but I did want to come out and take some — and take some questions.
Okay. Let’s see. All right. I’m going to try and call on people I haven’t called and start in the back, but there is like all these —
Go ahead. Go ahead. I don’t think I’ve called on you yet.
Q Not lately, so thank you.
Listen, Matthew McConaughey was banging on that podium just a few minutes ago before he left, and he had some specific policy asks. And a lot of them were — not all of them, but a lot were about guns.
He wanted to raise the age from 18 to 21 for AR-15s. He talked about a waiting period for AR-15s. And he talked about red-flag laws and background checks.
So my question is: You and the President have made very generalized comments lately about doing something. Why won’t he demand one of those things be in an overall package?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You’re talking about the President — why won’t he demand —
Q I know he supports the policies, but —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q — is his message to these negotiators that those gun measures needs to be — need to be in the package?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: His message to the negotiators is that we have to do something. His message is, to the American people: We have to do something.
He went to Uvalde, as you know. He went to Buffalo. And when he was in Uvalde — and I was there with him, and we — and some of you were there with him as well — the thing — the two words that he heard over and over again is please — is: Do something.
And so, he is very encouraged by the engagement that he’s seeing on the Senate side with the bipartisan group. And he wants to give them the space. We’re not going to negotiate from here on what should be in the package, what should not be in the package.
But we believe it’s a step forward. The President is going to continue to — continue to call for and fight for all of the comprehensive components for — to prevent gun violence that he talked about on Thursday. That will not stop. He’s going to continue to do that. But we’re just not going to negotiate from here.
Q And John Cornyn, in his public comments, was talking today on the Senate floor about really hardening doors at schools and these sort of items. If the package only has that and not one of these specific gun measures, will it be a success?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Again, I’m not going to negotiate from here. We’re going to let them — give them some space. It’s a bipartisan — it’s a bipartisan conversation that’s happening. It’s going to be a bipartisan agreement, we — we see or we feel.
And you know, Senator Murphy is very optimistic. And we’re — and he has said this is the most optimistic that he has been in some time. And he came in, as you know, and gave an update to the President.
So we’re going to see how this — this conversation continues to go.
Go ahead.
Q Thank you, Karine. Why do you think it is that 83 percent of people polled by The Wall Street Journal say the economy is “poor” or “not so good”?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, when it comes to consumer confidence — is what you’re talking about there — we know that can reflect concern and uncertainty about higher prices. People feel the effect of high prices when they go to the grocery store and they fill up their gans- — gas tank, which the President understands very personally — when he was growing up and understanding how — how when prices elevate even just a bit, how much that can hurt a family, how much that can really affect, you know, someone’s household.
But the fact is: We are in a fundamentally different place compared to when the President took office and compared to this time a year ago.
And so, you know, during this President — during his pres- — this presidency, people felt uncertainty — uncertain about the economy generally, but they actually felt as good about their personal financial situations as they ever have, according to the Federal Reserve survey, with nearly 80 percent of adults reporting that they are financially comfortable.
So, that matters as well.
Q But to the point about the — you’re saying that people feel good about their personal financial situation. High gas prices, people can’t get baby formula, the supply chain is messed up, everything is more expensive. Where’s the good part?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the survey that I just read off started in 2013. And that is the first time that we saw numbers like this since 2013. So that does — no, that does mean something. Just like you gave me 83 percent, I’m giving you —
Q And I understand that. Another number then —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I —
Q — newer than 2013, 61 percent are saying now, in this Wall Street Journal poll, they are generally pessimistic about people having an opportunity to achieve the American Dream. How’s that going look on a — on a bumper sticker?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I’m — I guess what I’m trying to say, Peter, is that we understand that people are feeling — feeling this. They are feeling the increase of prices, which — with food, in particular, right now, and gas. That is — that is something that we understand.
What we’re trying to say, what I’m trying to say to you is that the economy is in a better place than it has been historically.
And so, we feel, here at this administration and other experts as well, is that — we feel that we are in a good position to take on inflation. We are in a good position to really start really working on lowering prices.
We leave that piece to the Federal Reserve. They have the monetary policies to deal with the best — to have the best tools to make sure that we bring down inflation. That’s the — that’s the pain that the American family is feeling.
And so, that’s what we’re saying. We’re trying to — what we’re saying is that we were in a different place a year ago, and now we are in a much better place economically. But there’s still work to do, and we understand that.
Q Okay. And then, just quickly, on gas prices. The Energy Secretary, Granholm, is saying, “Oh, well, if you went to Canada, you’d be paying $6.25 a gallon. If you went to Germany, you’d be paying over $8.80. In the UK, it’s almost $8 a gallon.” What kind of an argument is that: “Just be happy you don’t live in Munich”?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think what she was — what she’s trying to say and what we have all been trying to say is this is a global challenge. This is not just in the United States that people are feeling inflation or people are seeing elevated gas prices. This is a global challenge.
Q And isn’t it the President’s job to protect Americans from global challenges?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: He’s doing — he’s doing his part in trying to make sure that we — the American people feel the impact less.
But here’s the thing, and we’ve talked about this: Since Russia invaded Ukraine, we have seen gas prices — these are the facts — go up by $1.51. We have seen food prices go up because of what — of what Ukraine and Russia represent when it comes to wheat and corn. This is just a fact. This is what we have seen for the past several months.
The President has done — he’s tapped into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a historic way with a million — a million barrels of oil a month for six months. We did — we made the announcement of the E15, the homegrown biofuels that is going to help families in the Midwest.
So, we know there is more to do. We’re not disagreeing here. We know that there is more to do, and we’re going to continue to do the work.
Q Does the President have any plans to invite any Republican senators to the White House before he leaves for Los Angeles?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I don’t have any — I don’t have any meetings to preview for you at this point.
Q Has he spoken to any Republicans as it comes to gun legislation?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have — I don’t have any meetings to — or calls to read out.
Okay, go ahead.
Q Karine, thank you. I know you don’t want to negotiate from the podium. I just want to try one more time. It seems as though talks are coalescing around more funding for mental health, school safety, and then expanded background checks and encouraging states to adapt red-flag laws. Is that the type of compromise legislation the President would sign? Would he sign that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I — again, I’m not going to negotiate from here. We don’t want to — I’m not going to talk through the contours of the plan. They’re still having those conversations on the other side of the Hill.
Q I guess the question is —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: But I can say — but no, no. Let me —
Q Okay.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Let me finish. I’ll get to — hopefully this will answer it, which is: He supports red-flag laws. That is something that he has supported for some time. He even talked about the red-flag law that is in Delaware — is named after his son, Beau Biden, who was, as you know, the Attorney General of — in Delaware.
He has talked about expanding background checks. I have talked about it. He has talked about it. We’ve all talked about it.
So, clearly, those are two things that we know are popular. The red-flag law — red-flag law we saw — I read a poll here last — yesterday that has 72 percent for the red-flag laws. We know that expanding background check is overwhelmingly popular as well.
So, clearly, those are two things that he support. But I just don’t — we do not want to get — give them some space, don’t want to get in the middle of their negotiation.
Q I guess what I’m asking, Karine —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, sure.
Q — is, particularly as it relates to the red-flag laws, what it seems to be coalescing around is a deal that would encourage states to adapt red-flag laws. Is that good enough for President Biden?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think it’s a step. It’s — when red-flag laws are actually enacted, it saves lives. We have seen that in Florida. We’ve seen that in other states across the country. In California, there’s been cases where the red-flag law has actually saved lives.
And we know, we understand not every component of what the President is calling for is going to stop every tragedy, but we have to take the steps, and we have to move forward, and we have to do something.
Q There’s been so much focus on the legislation. Is President Biden considering any new executive actions on the (inaudible) guns?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You know, the President said this himself: If there is any way or any other new actions that he can take, he will. His team —
Q Is he actively considering any?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: There’s nothing that I can — that I can preview for you at this time. I know that the team is looking at that. We just don’t have anything for you — to share at this time.
Q Let me ask you on Roe v. Wade, if I might. We are anticipating the Supreme Court will render its final decision on Roe v. Wade. And based on, of course, that leaked draft report, it appears as though the Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.
What, if any, groundwork is the President, is this administration laying to ensure that women who want or need abortions can still have access to them?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, protecting the constitutional rights of Americans afforded by Roe for — for nearly 50 years, ensuring that women can make their own choices about their lives and bodies and families, is something that the President and the Vice President support.
For — for we’ve — we’ve taken actions over the past — the past year and a half on making sure that — making sure that women have the protection that they need, issuing a presidential memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive repre- — reproductive healthcare and to revoke the Mexico City policy, a global gag rule that prohibits federal funding for organizations that provide abortion, counseling, and/or referrals; issuing a final rule to strengthen the Title 10 Family Planning Program, fulfilling the administration’s commitment to restore access to equitable, affordable, client-centered quality family planning services.
So, we have done — we have done an array of things over the past year and a half to give the protection that women need.
Obviously, the decision, it was a draft decision. We don’t want to get into hypotheticals and we don’t want to get ahead of of what is actually going to come forth. But it’s something that it concerns us. All of the pieces of legislation that we see coming out of the states that are incredibly radical, we’ve called them that and it does give us concern.
Q Are there any tangible actions that the administration will take if it’s overturned on that day or that week to ensure that women who need abortions can have access to them or that they can cross state lines to access an abortion?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, one thing that I can say — I don’t have anything to preview or to announce or to lay out at this time. What I can say is that our team here — the Gender Policy Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the agencies who are involved, like HHS — have been in constant communication with — with groups on what we can do from here. I just don’t have anything to preview.
Q Karine, the January 6th Committee is going to hold its first public hearing on Thursday while the President is in California. Do you expect the President to get briefed on what the committee has found in its investigation, if he hasn’t already? And how is he looking at these hearings? Does he see this as something that will move the needle in how the public perceives what happened on that day?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, we’re leaving, as you were kind of alluding to, tomorrow, and we’re going to go to LA. The President is going to have a very busy week. And, you know, of course, will be keeping up on the committee’s work, as he has been. And I’m sure he’ll be following the news from the hearing as well.
I don’t have anything else to — in particular to share here. The President has been consistent voicing his support for the vital work of the bipartisan January 6th Select Committee. And he and his team have said many times it is critical that we have a full investigation into the events of January 6th to ensure something like what we saw that day can never happen again. And the work of this committee is crucial to that effort. And we will continue to speak out as appropriate or to defend our democracy and the rule of law, and to support those who are doing work to protect our democracy.
Q Just one more. Senator Romney and Senator Ossoff have asked for a full investigation into the death of Shireen Abu Akleh. She was a Palestinian American journalist with Al Jazeera. She was killed last month while reporting in the West Bank. Will the White House be supporting an investigation into her death?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, we’re in close touch with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities. The United States is not currently conducting an official investigation. As you know, we are working to bridge cooperation between the two parties.
We have made clear our view to both Israeli and Palestinian officials the administration’s call for thorough, transparent, and impartial investigation of her — of her killing. We expect full accountability for those responsible. We have also urged that both sides share their evidence with each other.
We continue to call on all sides to maintain calm and avoid any further escalation.
Q Karine, thanks so much. Secretary Yellen said over the weekend to CNN that she was “wrong” in predicting that inflation was transitory. And shortly afterward, Treasury walked back the statement. I’m just curious if the White House or any senior aides here were involved in walking back that — those comments.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: What I can tell you is that she — she was — even when you look at the transcript, she was clear on exactly what she meant by that. And she — she — the Secretary, you know, spoke to this herself to clarify her remarks. And it’s true that nobody at the time foresaw the extent of the global challenges that have caused record inflation all around the world. In fact, even Wall Street and the private sector broadly thought that inflation would come down faster than it has.
I cannot speak to private conversation. But all I can say is she put out a — as you know, put out a statement clarifying what she said.
Q And just one more question. On Friday, senior White House staff met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus to talk about some of the President’s ideas for forgiving student debt. I’m wondering: What was the purpose of that meeting, as the President considers it? And was there any outcome from it?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have any readout from that meeting from Friday night.
Q Thank you. Based on what you know about the situation in both Uvalde and Buffalo, is there anything that the Senate negotiators are considering now that would have stopped those two shootings, or even one of them?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I — look, I — you know, I’m no expert here, but one thing that I do know that we all know is that both the shooters were 18. And one of the things that are — that’s on the table is raising the age limit.
Q Are you sure that’s on the table?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: What — I’m so sorry —
Q Raising the age limit from 18 to 21 to buy AR-15s? Because John Cornyn has said that’s not on the table.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. I’m just saying it’s been discussed. I don’t —
Q Oh, I see. Okay.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m —
Q Okay. If that was on the table, that would have affected these.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, I —
Q Okay. But —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You’re — you’re asking me a question of when I thought — what I think may have helped or — stopped this awful (inaudible).
Q Certainly it would have been. But in terms of what’s on the table in the Senate?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t — I’m just saying that’s been one of the conversations that’s been out there. I do not know. Again, we’re not negotiating from here. I’m just trying to make a point. This is something that the President supports — raising the age from 18 to 21. Because one of the things that we do know is both of the shooters were 18 years old. The one in Uvalde, in particular, when he was 17, he asked his sister to buy him a gun. She said, “No.” And as soon as he turned 18, he went and bought — he bought — he bought a gun.
And so, that is something that we have heard about, that’s out there, and that is something the President talked about on Thursday.
And so, I was just speaking to your question on what you — what I — what, potentially, could have helped.
Q Well, I’m actually asking what the sen- — what among the things the senators are considering could have prevented this?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And, again, I’m not going to negotiate from here. I’m just trying to help in a way to show, “Hey, this is something that we know is out there.” This is something that the President talked about. I’m not going to negotiate from here. They’re working through the contours of the plan, and we’re going to let them figure that out.
Q Can I just ask one quick one on red-flag laws? So does the — does the President prefer a federal red-flag law? Or does he think it’s better on a state-by-state level and the government — or the federal government should incentivize states instead?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, he supports a red- — he supports — I want to be really careful here because he’s not going to — we’re not going to negotiate from here. Right? We are going to allow the — we’re going to give them the space to come up with the contours of — of the deal. And we’re just going to give them that space.
What we’re saying is: We support the red-flag law. The Pre- — the President has talked about it. I’m not going to go into the nitty-gritty of what that looks like. We’re going to let the negotiators figure that out.
Go ahead, Karen.
Q Thanks, Karine. First — or two questions. First, can you commit that going forward, if there was a guest or a celebrity here that you would ensure that they would stay at the podium and take questions from reporters —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, I —
Q — after they speak?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That — they’re a guest. That is not for me to ensure.
Q Can you try to have them stay and take questions?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — they’re — Karen, they’re a guest of ours. It is up to them if they want to take questions or not. We respect them and what they want to do.
Matthew was here. And when he was done, he said thank you and he walked away.
That is — that really is up to — is up to him.
Q And on COVID: Last week, a guest, Dr. Jha, was here. But he did take questions after —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.) Yeah, well that’s a little different. He works here. (Laughs.)
Q Absolutely. We appreciated him taking questions, but —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.
Q He said that what keeps them awake at night is that the U.S. would run out of vaccines, not have enough of the next generation of vaccines, run out of treatments and tests in the fall. And this is something he has been saying a lot in interviews recently.
But can you give us an update on where the COVID funding talks stand on the Hill, in terms of what the White House is doing right now? What officials are meeting with lawmakers up there? Has there been any progress? Has the President talked with lawmakers about this? And is this getting overshadowed with the conversations that are happening right now on gun talks?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, it’s a very good question. You know, look, just to kind of reiterate a little bit of what Dr. Jha has said is: Without additional funding, you know, we are unable to purchase li- — lifesaving treatments for the American people, including our most vulnerable. We’re already — we’ve already cut down on our purchase of treatments for high-risk Americans.
Imagine an — a 13-year-old with a heart condition who may not be able to access preventive treatment to stay safe from a life-threatening illness.
We’re losing our spot in line while other countries are moving forward and buying next-generation vaccines for all Americans that may be needed in the fall and winter.
So I think that’s what he’s talking about when he says he’s losing — he’s losing sleep. You know, when we think about the path forward and how we’re going to get to where we need to be — you know, we are working closely with members of Congress on a bipartisan basis to drive a path forward on COVID funding, and the President is committing to get — committed to getting that — getting it done.
And so, Dr. Jha and OMB Director have been — have been on the Hill having those meetings.
So, you know, the President deals with multiple things at a time. So this is still a — very much a priority. So we will continue doing our part to protect the American people. We’ll use the few funds we have remaining to continue getting testing, treatments, and vaccine out to the — to Americans for as long as we can.
We will continue to work the phones, hold briefings, and make our case public — publicly and privately with lawmakers, imploring Congress to act immediately (inaudible) on our long-overdue COVID — to act on our long-overdue COVID needs.
And at the end of the day, it’s Republicans in Congress — they need to act. They have to answer to the American people if they can’t get the vaccine treatments and tests that we will need come fall.
So, you know, we’re going to continue doing the work. The work doesn’t stop.
Q (Cross-talk by reporters.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, my gosh.
S.V.
Q Yeah, thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q Following up on the January 6th question: There have been Republicans — prominent Republicans, as well as outside groups, who are already making a concerted effort to downplay the entire thing before a single word has been said about — in the hearings. Has the President — what are his thoughts about that? And has he made any efforts to reach out to Kevin McCarthy, to Mitch McConnell about, “Hey, this is important. We ought to be on the same page with this”?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So the President has been really clear — right? — he supports the bipartisan effort — the January 6th Select Committee bipartisan effort. But we’re not going to get involved. That is something that is independent and needs to stay independent.
You know, it is important to protect our democracy. That is something that the President — what happened on January 6th was a very dark day in our democracy. And so, we have to continue to find ways to protect it.
So he supports what they’re doing. We’re not going to get involved. It’s an independent committee.
Q Karine? Karine? Back here.
Q Yeah, so you said that we’re in a stable economic — or we’re transitioning into a stable economic growth. The Treasury Secretary also testified today we’re going to a stable economic growth. What exactly is a “stable economic growth”?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think the way that we’re looking at it is just the data, just what we have seen in this past year.
I think people forget what the President inherited when he walked in. You had 20 million people who were collecting unemployment benefits. You — you had — unemployment was at more than 6 percent.
And the work that he did with the American Rescue Plan, getting that done, and the Democrats — only Democrats voting for it, helped get the economy moving, helped get the economy growing.
And so, the way we see it is that we are in a strong place. The U.S. economy may grow faster this year than China’s economy for the first time since 1976. With — with the right policies, we are confident that the U.S. can transition from recovery to stable, steady growth and bring down inflation without giving all of these historic gains that I just laid out — 8.7 million new jobs in this past year and a half.
And so, one of the things that we’ve been very clear about is giving the Federal Reserve the independence to deal with inflation. And they are committed to it; we are committed to it. And they have the strongest tools to come up with monetary policy to get that done.
Q So — but is that — is that GDP growth, like under the Obama administration, 1.5 percent, 1.8 percent for the year?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, I’m not going to get into, like, the specifics of GDP growth. But what I can say is the numbers — the data that we have seen just on job growth — 390,000 jobs in the month of May — what we have seen is historic numbers, is a his- — we are in a historic place in history — historic place right now, as we have — as we look at where we are with the economy. Very, very different than where we were a year ago.
And that is because of what the President has been able to do with a comprehensive plan to get people vaccinated, with a plan to get people back to work.
Remember — and I know some of you know this — schools were closed when he — when he entered the administration. Businesses were closed when he entered the administration. The economy was in crisis. We are in a different place. That’s what — that’s how we see this.
Q One quick one. Are we in a recession then? Because the Atlanta Fed GDP now looks at a snapshot, and it’s 0.9 percent. It’s gone down from 1.9 to 1.3 for the second quarter. Two quarters in a row of negative growth is a recession. So are we there? And how close —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, the way that we see it is we have the right tools, and we are in a strong place to continue to get — to get our — to be in this transition where we have stable — stable growth. And that is what’s important. And so, that’s going to be our focus.
Q Thank you. Will you follow up?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Thank you, guys. I actually — I do have to go. I really do have to go.
Q Thanks for coming back out.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. I appreciate that. Thanks, guys. Thank you.

""But with Omicron’s arrival, we’ve been forced to rethink what it will take to keep the business alive each day while keeping both our staff and our diners safe,"" he writes. Initially, he had to close @lazybettyatl and furlough its workers, handing out food from its walk-in refrigerator and saying goodbye. Then the mayor proclaimed that in-person dining could stay open for takeout, so the restaurant shifted from tasting menus to family-style meals that could survive 40 minutes in a foil box. ""Line cooks who used to carefully smoke crab legs now roasted whole chickens. Everyone washed dishes. I delivered some takeout orders. Servers became launderers,"" @chefhsu says. With the eventual resumption of in-person dining, he invested in a host of safety measures and put up a makeshift tent that cost $6,300. But then came Omicron and soon after, one member of the 41-person staff tested positive for Covid, forcing a weekend closure. The restaurant lost over $38,000 in revenue over two days, he writes. ""Inspecting our walk-in fridge, I saw thousands of dollars worth of foie gras, white truffles and ducks that had been dry aging for two weeks. I felt a sickeningly familiar sense of uncertainty and fear,"" he says.
