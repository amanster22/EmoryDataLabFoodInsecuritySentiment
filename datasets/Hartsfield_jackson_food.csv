The inspection, conducted by local health authorities, revealed several violations that led to the lounge‚Äôs low score. Among the cited issues were uncovered food items, which pose a risk of contamination, an unclean ice machine, which could compromise beverage safety, and the presence of flies near the bar area, indicating potential pest control problems.

This development has raised concerns among frequent flyers and airport visitors who had looked forward to the luxury and exclusivity promised by the Centurion Lounge. American Express officials have not yet responded to requests for comment on the inspection results or on what steps will be taken to address these health and safety issues.

Local health officials have emphasized the importance of maintaining high hygiene standards in public spaces, especially in high-traffic areas like airports. They have indicated that follow-up inspections will be conducted to ensure compliance with health regulations.

Travelers are advised to stay informed on the status of the lounge before planning to visit. Meanwhile, the airport authority has assured the public that they are committed to upholding the health and safety standards across all facilities within Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.", ,no longer populated,,2024-12-19T01:27:34.000Z,post data removed,,-1,0,541,0,,

Vision 100, the airport‚Äôs strategic plan to reach that number ahead of its 50th anniversary in 2045, originally planned to hit the mark between 2030 and 2035.

The boost in travelers has made DIA the 6th busiest airport in the world behind Dallas-Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Tokyo International, Dubai International, and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International airports. 

However, it appears that the rapid growth has also resulted in fewer satisfied customers. A J.D. Power survey shows DIA ranked 12th out of 20 mega airports in 2024, falling five slots from 2023. That annual survey looks at six factors: terminal facilities; arrival/departure areas; baggage claim; security check; check-in/baggage check; and food, beverage and retail.

The demand to have library books censored is on the rise
in Ark Nation, and new data from the
American Library Association shows more than 1200 demands to censor library booksd resources were logged last year. That&#39;s the highest number since the group started collecting suh data more than 20 years ago. But one bookstore in Decatur is celebrating these controversial. Applications Little Shop of Stos on East Court Square hosts a bad book club which hopes to shine a light on the books that some want to keep in the dark. The bookstores manager
says one
of the reasons for the club is to educe people that the rise in challeng and banning books should not be something that seems
foreign to people living in Decatur. I
try and, you know, grab from a broad swath
so that
we can sort of ask these fundamental
questions. What is it about these books? Is there something that links t, that makes people want
to to challenge them, that makes people afraid? On Monday, the American
Library Association will unveil its annual list of e top 10 most challenged books ine US as part of National Library .
