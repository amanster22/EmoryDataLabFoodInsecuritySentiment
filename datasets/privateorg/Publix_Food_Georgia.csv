It's our second Community Food Center built to ensure convenient, consistent, frequent, and equitable access to food assistance across our service area.

The Community Food Center established in Marieta will operate as a food pantry, directly distributing food to local families. The new site is expected to help approximately 700 families weekly and will continue to scale up as needed. 

The new CFC is made possible in part by the generous support of the
following founding donors: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Publix Super Markets Charities,
Subramonian and Lakshmi Shankar, Kaiser Permanente of Georgia, The True Vine Experience Foundation, and Delta Air Lines.
