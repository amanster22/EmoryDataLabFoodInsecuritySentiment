This is really a big
deal if you know anything about that area, 11 li. Brittany Kleinpeter has more on how this area has transformed or the years and how critical this grocery store is for the people who live in that community. It was really just like a an laf nothingness. Located in the heart of downtown, only blocks from the Georgia State Stadium, sits the community of Summerhil. When we first moved here, it wa. UKIP see that there was movement and that there was definite ene, but it was basically
like a neglected community. Longtime residents
like Nicole and her husband say they
have gone without for years. People were here. It was just that a lot
of the infrastructure and those things that make a ciy were not here. And that&#39;s why both leaders and residents recognize the opening of a public grocery store means more than just a supermarket coming to a neighborhood. Fresh food access is very import to the vitality of communities. When we moved here is definitely a food desert, and as we&#39;ve gone through the many layers of movet and development within Summerhi, we&#39;ve seen so much
growth and
this is just adding to the growth. Justo give you an idea of how much ths area has transformed over the y, this is what it looked
like on Georgia Ave. right around the corner
from where the grocery store now stands
10 years ago. Over the last few years, you can see the dramatic
transformation in the area from murals to new construction to what it looks l. Now today with multiple restaurants lining the block, look historically of what Summer Hill was and
to the community, especially to the African Amerin and the black community what it. Just to see Summer
Hill really coming back and return to his resurgene of who it is and what it was is just a beautiful thing. Many believe the grocery store, which will include a pharmacy aa Piedmont urgent care is a welcod into what was and the emergence of what Summer Hill will now be. Brittany Kleinpeter 11 Alive News Mayor Andre Dickens says. As his administration has plans to bring grocery stores to other area food deserts as well, he says up next is Campbellton . Martin Luther King Junior Drive and other Southside areas.
