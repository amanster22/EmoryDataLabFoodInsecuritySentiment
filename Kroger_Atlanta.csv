We&#39;re all feeling the sting of the higher prices right now at the grocery store. So where can you get the most for your money? Love alive. Liza Lucas went to four different chains with the same grocery list to find out who offered the best price for Marcia Smith. A run to get groceries is all about strategy. I really started to stop buying in bulk so much like I literally have to purchase stuff week by week, the past few years have been hard on family food budgets and while inflation has leveled off in the past 12 months, grocery prices remain high shoppers like John Horn continue to adjust to the higher cost. Well, I always look for deals. So yes, I look for things that were on sale. A little bit more things that were closer to the expiration dates. If we knew we were going to use them soon. Here at 11 live, we set out to determine which store offers the best prices to help you get the most for your money. We&#39;re going to store with the same shopping list looking for basics like bread, milk eggs, things like that. And where possible. We&#39;re gonna buy store brands. Let&#39;s go. I popped by four major chain stores, Walmart, Publix, Kroger and Ingles, which have the largest market share in Metro Atlanta. According to data from the chain store guide and at each stop I shop for the same eight items in the same amount. A 40 ounce jar of peanut butter, a pound of 8020 ground beef, a dozen white eggs. Ok. We gotta get that milk, basic white bread. Remember we&#39;re gonna grab store brand where possible a frozen cheese pizza, a box of mac and cheese. Ok. We&#39;ve got our bananas. Let&#39;s see how it adds up. We came back with all of our bags and checked our receipts overall. We did the best at Walmart spending just over $21 before tax. Next was Kroger where we spent $25.12 followed by Ingles with $27.84. The priciest bill was Publix where we spent just over $29 and approximately $8 difference. We did notice an advantage to shopping around. For example, we found a sale price on ground beef the day we shopped at Ingles while we scored the cheapest cheese pizza at Kroger. Those we spoke with also avoid sticking to just one store these days. They&#39;re watching sales and monitoring prices definitely like kind of shop around and find where I&#39;m going get things at the, at the best value. And it&#39;s kind of crazy. I never had to do that before, but you really have to watch what you&#39;re spending because it will get costly. Liza Lucas 11. A live news. Ok. So our experiment was simple. We shopped minus special coupons or special store app. So we later followed up with the stores for their recommended ways to save. That includes tapping into the store websites for recipes, digital coupons and special deals which can potentially increase your savings.

Dekalb County fire is investigating after someone threw a flaming object into a home overnight, it happened on Springside Drive. That is where we find 11 Eli Spo, Beth Yates, Bo Beth, you talked to that disturbed homeowner this morning. What did they have to say? Yes, I did talk to him. Ayesha and we&#39;re in the Candler mcafee neighborhood and when we spoke, he was visibly shaken up saying he no longer feels comfortable in his own home. All of a sudden there was the explosion and then that was something that came through the window. Take a look at your screen. Surveillance video shows the horrific moments. A Dekalb homeowner who asked us to hide his identity experienced early Friday morning when someone threw a mock cocktail at his home. You can even see the person running from the scene shortly after the explosion. It was flames, it burned the curtain but the curtain stopped everything. So I got up walking through the house, you know, trying to see what was going on, ducking, making sure that there were going to be any shots or the incident occurred on Springside Drive in Dekalb County around 3 a.m. Fire investigators were on scene trying to piece together why and who threw the makeshift bomb at the home. But as the investigation continues, neighbors remain on edge, it is somewhat shocking that a molotov cocktail would be thrown. That is shocking in this area. That&#39;s hard to believe in this neighborhood. And the homeowner who was asleep on the couch when the explosive device came through the window remains in disbelief that I&#39;m not used to. It makes me feel I&#39;m uncomfortable for one thing. Now, investigators left the scene about 10 o&#39;clock and they tell me their investigation is ongoing. They say right now they don&#39;t have any witness or potential suspects, but they expect that to change in the few in, in a few live in Atlanta. Be be Yates 11. A live news.

Hang out with me while I visit an infamous Atlanta location ...",what is going on everybody welcome back to the cosmic wonder I'm Warren Thompson and the Fantastic forecast has officially been announced but we only have the members of the Fantastic 4 announced and of course there is going to be a villain or villains in the movie and from recent reports it sounds like the answer is villains with the recent rumors looking to be true that the villain of the film is going to be galatis and the Silver Surfer plus possibly possibly Dr Doom we had heard Marvel Studios had plans for Doom possibly and now according to a recent Insider it sounds like those plans are indeed coming to fruition now first and foremost I am sure you have heard by now but in case you haven't the official cast has been announced and Pedro Pascal is Reed Richards Vanessa Kirby is Sue storm and I absolutely love that casting Choice Joseph Quinn is the Human Torch and I am definitely open to seeing what he can bring to the table and ibon Moss Bakr is going to be playing the thing and I really like this casting because one I think he's going to do a good job I think he's a great actor but two I really like that he was in The Punisher series as micro microchip so I think it's kind of cool plus of course we know that he's going to be probably CGI maybe they do a combination of a suit and CGI for the thing but I'm assuming they're going to do it like the Hulk so mostly map and CGI so that is our official cast and Marvel Studios did announce this themselves on Valentine's Day they released a few posters and a brand new logo for the Fantastic 4 movie but now of course course the question is well who are the villains going to be well like I said seems like we have our answer for that Galactus the Silver Surfer and possibly a little quick Cameo for Doom possibly in the post credit scene of course we're going to get to that in this video but it looks like we might have casting news on who could be playing galatis in fact it sounds like Marvel Studios has the actor in mind they want to play him and or just voice him over and according to Jeff Insider from the insider.com Marvel Studios is still looking looking at Javier bardam as their top choice for the role of galatis in the Fantastic 4 movie as the main villain according to Jeff Snider Marvel is currently trying to figure out his schedule due to his involvement with a different film so Javier bartom right away go ahead and let me know what you think about this in the comments think of his voice do you think he would make a great galatis I personally think he do a really good job but I was really kind of set on either Liam niss or Antonio Banderas playing gal practice having said that Javier bardam does have a really nice deep voice and I think if he enunciates very clearly then he could do a really good job now this is the next step in Marvel studios's process for the casting of the Fantastic 4 they have locked in the first family the actual Fantastic 4 team now they are trying to find the rest of the cast but obviously the villains are the next important casting so that is happening right now and with this as I mentioned also comes the news that they are currently casting for the Silver Surfer right now now we've heard rumors about this before but this report basically confirms that the two villains of the film are indeed going to be galatis and the Silver Surfer which makes sense because of course galatis has a Herald the recent reports we've heard is that Marvel Studios is considering casting a female Silver Surfer having a female version of the character nothing has been reported about that recently with this casting news but that is something to keep in mind and again also keep in mind as I've said before and as it really does appear to be now this Fantastic 4 movie The Fantastic 4 team is most likely going to take place in a separate Universe than the 616 MCU since we're in the Multiverse Saga and since we're dealing with Avengers Secret Wars it looks like at some point in time the Multiverse will indeed collapse and they will end up in the same universe or maybe void in SpaceTime not existing in any Universe like where the TVA is located and ultimately they will be with the Avengers on the other characters from our universe then after the soft reboot after Avengers Secret Wars they will will basically remain in the same universe that our Avengers and other characters are going to continue on so the Silver Surfer that we're going to see in the film and galatis that we are going to see in the film are probably not going to roll over into the main Universe moving forward after Secret Wars like the Fantastic 4 are going to so I'm okay with it not being norn rad the main Silver Surfer because he could exist in the new universe that we continue on in along with the new Galactus as well because that's very important we don't want Galactus to just appear in one movie and then be done we would love him to be a big bad or at least be bigger than just one movie and we definitely don't want him as a giant Cloud please hear us Marvel but with the Fantastic forecasting news some people are thinking Ryan Gosling because we know that Ryan Gosling has been meeting with Marvel Studios pretty frequently over the past year or so now I will interrupt this Fantastic 4 video to talk about Ghost Rider real quick because according to recent reports we are indeed getting Ghost Rider in the MCU relatively soon and that Marvel Studios is actually looking for an actor right now to play Ghost Rider in the MCU so I'm sure Ryan Gosling is actually being considered for both roles as we've stated many times on the channel as most of you probably know Kevin fee meets with a lot of actors for a lot of different roles until they find the perfect role so I'm sure he's being considered for both perhaps one of these is the role that will get Ryan Golan in the MCU could be the Silver Surfer but it also could be Ghost Rider but I hope I hope it's not Dr Doom I love Ryan goling I don't think he would be the man for Dr Doom and according to another report from Jeff Snider the same one who reported these last two about the Silver Surfer in Galactus according to him Doom will reportedly appear in the Fantastic 4 but at the very end of the film this is in line with other reports that we've had in the past that he might just simply cameo in the Fantastic 4 for like 5 seconds or maybe they just simply mention his name Victor Von Doom but keep in mind and if you don't know this let me explain Victor Von Doom Dr Doom is basically one of the main characters in Avengers Secret Wars he is pretty much the main villain in both of the secret War Stories from the comics now obviously the MCU is doing it differently as they should obviously Kang is seemingly still going to be the main focus and a beyonder king variant seems to be the main villain of the entire multivers Saga and Secret Wars but they should definitely have do Doom in it especially after that Dr Doom Secret Wars Easter egg in the Deadpool in Wolverine trailer we talked about this in the breakdown but if you missed it at the very end of the Deadpool and Wolverine trailer Wolverine throws Deadpool through a wall Deadpool is laying on the ground and as Wolverine walks up and we see a shadow you can take a look on the left here and you can see a secret Wars comic but this specific comic they used is Secret Wars number five of eight with Dr Doom's face on the cover so what we are looking at here is a pretty big do Doom Easter egg and we know that Deadpool and Wolverine the movie is going to directly set up of Avengers Secret Wars it's even been reported that Deadpool and Wolverine are going to show a lot of universes kind of coming together collapsing a lot of the heroes will be taken from a lot of different universes and come into one place so perhaps if the Fantastic 4 film really does take place in Another Universe and they get brought into some area with all these other Heroes Dr Doom will join them yes Reed Richards is the smartest man alive but don't forget Dr Doom is incredibly smart as well he even attended college with Reed Richards he's insanely smart as well and he's also a sorcerer so I'm not sure how they're going to portray him in the Fantastic 4 film but if their universe is about to collapse I'm sure Dr Doom would know this and since he does know how smart Reed is and perhaps he has some sort of specific technology in the movie he might go to the Fantastic 4 to see what's up and possibly even try to save his life and that could take him over into whatever Universe they end up in and bring him into Secret Wars maybe not as a main villain but simply as one of the many different cameos that we are going to see in that movie so according to Jeff Snyder they are going to cast for Doom later on in production of the film which makes sense since he's only going to appear at the very end maybe even a post credit scene probably only get 10 seconds on screen if that it makes sense that they would get the rest of the cast locked in before obviously but this does make me even more excited for the Fantastic 4 we've had a lot of great things happen this week and this is just one more thing to make it awesome so let me know your

ATLANTA ‚Äì The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) is urging Georgians to be cautious about eating pre-cut cantaloupe if they cannot verify its source. At least five people in Georgia have become infected with Salmonella likely due to eating the contaminated cantaloupe. Across the country, 117 people have also been sickened, nearly half requiring hospitalization. The Salmonella cases reported in Georgia range in age from 1-81. The cases are from different areas of the state, not concentrated in any one place. One individual was hospitalized but has since been released. The recalled cantaloupe is sold in Georgia at Sprouts Farmers Market, Trader Joes, and Kroger stores. The cantaloupe is sold as pre-cut chunks or in fruit mixes. Whole cantaloupes that are also part of the recall may have a sticker that says ‚ÄúMalichita‚Äù or ‚ÄúRudy‚Äù, with the number 4050 and ‚ÄúProduct of Mexico/produit du Mexique. ‚Äù More information about the recall can be found on the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-Salmonella-cantaloupes-november-2023. Most people infected with Salmonella experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps and recover without treatment in 4-7 days. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is concerned about this outbreak because the illnesses associated with it are severe, including fevers higher than 102¬∞F, not being able to keep down liquids, and diarrhea that lasts more than three days without improving. Individuals who may have eaten the recalled cantaloupe should contact their healthcare provider if they have severe Salmonella symptoms. Do not eat pre-cut cantaloupe or whole cantaloupe if you don‚Äôt know whether it is Malichita or Rudy brand. If you have any of the recalled cantaloupe, throw it away or return it to the store where you purchased it. Rinsing pre-cut cantaloupe does not remove all germs if it is already contaminated with Salmonella. Rinsing whole cantaloupes can reduce the number of germs but it does not remove all germs. Germs on the surface of cantaloupes can then get onto the knife and inside the fruit when you cut the cantaloupe. Wash items and surfaces that may have touched the cantaloupe using hot soapy water or a dishwasher.

TAKE A LIVE LOOK DOWN INDEPENDENCE BOULEVARD IS CHARLOTTE, MUCH DIFFERENT VIEW FROM WHAT WE&#39;VE SEEN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. BLUE SKIES, CALM CONDITIONS REALLY LIKE THAT TODAY. CHIEF METEOROLOGIST SARAH LANE IS HERE WITH. &gt;&gt; HOW ARE SHAPING UP FOR THAT WEEKEND WEEKEND? LOOKS GREAT. AND ACTUALLY THIS DRY STRETCH IS REALLY GOING TO STICK AROUND FOR A WHILE. THE ONLY CHANGE THAT WE&#39;RE GOING TO SEE GOING INTO NEXT WEEK AS THAT. WELL, HE&#39;S GOING TO BE BACK MORE HEAT, MORE HUMIDITY. AND WE&#39;RE TALKING HIGHS WELL INTO THE 90&#39;S AGAIN, BUT IT&#39;S NOT GETTING THAT HOT YET FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS OR SO. WE&#39;VE GOT THE DRIER CONDITIONS SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES, OF COURSE, YESTERDAY WAS COOLER WITH THE RAIN DEVELOPING. BUT A LITTLE BIT ON THE COOL SIDE FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AS A DOLLY AND MOVES AWAY, WE&#39;VE HAD A COLD FRONT SLIDING OFF TO THE EAST. STILL SOME OF THAT STORM SURGE FLOODING LINGERING RAIN OVER EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CAROLINAS. THE PAMLICO AND ALBEMARLE SOUNDS THERE AND HEADING OUT TOWARD THE OUTER BANKS. BUT &gt;&gt; AGAIN, HIGH PRESSURE IS IS SQUASHING OUT ANY SIGNIFICANT RAIN CHANCES FOR US FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE NOW, WHILE WE&#39;RE ON THIS AFTER THE TROPICS, THOUGH, WE HAVE A WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS AS IT&#39;S TO TRY TO HEAD TOWARD BERMUDA ACTUALLY FOR THE WEEKEND. SO COULD HIT THEM AS A TROPICAL STORM. BUT THEN WE&#39;VE GOT FRANKLIN WHICH MOVED BY BERMUDA A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND STILL A HURRICANE, BUT THAT IS MOVING NORTH. WE ALSO HAVE IF YOU DIDN&#39;T HEAR ABOUT THIS YET WE HAVE TROPICAL DEPRESSION NUMBER 11 THAT BECAME TROPICAL STORM JOSE. BUT THAT WILL ACTUALLY HEAD TOWARD FRANKLIN IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND MERGE WITH THAT SYSTEM. MEANTIME, WE HAVE A FEW OTHER DISTURBANCES OUT. THERE ARE NO MAJOR CONCERNS JUST YET WATCHING THIS ONE AND SEE IF IT DEVELOPS ANY FURTHER HERE IN THE COMING DAYS AS IT ROAMS THROUGH THE ATLANTA. BUT BASICALLY PRETTY ACTIVE. TROPICAL UPDATE MAP THERE TO SHOW YOU NOW CLOSER TO HOME. WE&#39;VE GOT THOSE TEMPERATURES SITTING IN THE LOW AND MID 80&#39;S. WE&#39;VE GOT THE LOW AND MID 70&#39;S UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. THE WIND HAS BEEN PICKING UP A LITTLE BREEZY TODAY, NOT TOO BAD AT THE MOMENT. DEW POINTS ARE MUCH DRIER. SO WITH THAT DRY AIR, MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AS THE WIND CONTINUES TO SETTLE FOR THE NIGHT, THAT WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO REALLY COOL DOWN. WE&#39;RE GOING TO BE WAKING UP TO SOME UPPER 40&#39;S IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS TOMORROW, MOSTLY CLEAR SKY. LOOK AT MID 50&#39;S TOMORROW MORNING IN SALISBURY AND ALBEMARLE DOWN TO 56 TO START THE DAY TOMORROW AND RIGHT AT 60 AROUND THE CHARLOTTE AREA AND MORE UPPER 50&#39;S DOWN THROUGH THE UPSTATE CHESTER ROCKHILL IN FORT MILL. JUST BOTTOM LINE, A DELIGHTFUL, REFRESHING START TO THE DAY AND TOMORROW AFTERNOON, NOT TOO SHABBY EITHER. 83 FOR THAT FORECAST HIGH. LOTS OF SUNSHINE UNDER THAT MOSTLY CLEAR SKY. AND THEN WE HEAD INTO THE ACTUAL LABOR DAY WEEKEND. ANYTHING OUTSIDE. WE ARE LOOKING GOOD. THE ONLY THING IS IT WILL START TO FEEL HOTTER. LITTLE MORE HUMID, ESPECIALLY BY MONDAY. NOTHING TERRIBLY STEAMY. JUST YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THAT HIGH 93 ON MONDAY, BUT ONLY 85 ON SATURDAY AND RIGHT AT ABOUT 90 ON SUNDAY. NO GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN ON THE WAY ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT SATURDAY. WE HAVE COLLEGE GAMEDAY. WE HAVE DUKE&#39;S MAYO CLASSIC KICKING OFF AT 7.30, UPTOWN UNC VERSUS SOUTH CAROLINA. 79 DEGREES AT KICKOFF. WEATHER IS LOOKING GREAT. LIGHT WIND OUT THERE UNDER THAT MOSTLY CLEAR SKY MOUNTAIN FORECAST MUCH THE SAME TEMPERATURES, OF COURSE, NOT QUITE AS WARM THEIR NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS LOW TO MID 70&#39;S. BUT THEN YOU ALL TO WILL BE HEATING UP A LITTLE MORE INTO THE MID 80&#39;S BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. AND LOOK, THOSE LOW TEMPERATURES, AS I SAID, SOME UPPER 40&#39;S LOW 50&#39;S. THEY&#39;RE GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. AND THEN THOSE EARLY MORNING TEMPS START TO CLIMB AS WELL AS THE HUMIDITY INCREASES GOING INTO NEXT WEEK. SO FINE WEATHER TO ENJOY IT FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE HERE. IT&#39;S JUST GOING TO GET HOTTER.

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/11Alive/","First, tonight at 11, a registered sex offender working as a motel clerk is accused of setting up a room to buy and sell a teenager for sex. Deonte Johnson was arrested this week, charged with trafficking, and he&#39;s one of six men charged with either buying or selling a 15 year old girl. Now, Cody Alcorn joins us now from outside the motel where Johnson worked in West Atlanta. It&#39;s a story you&#39;ll only see on 11 alive. It was inside this motel along Fulton Industrial Blvd. A 15 year old girl was being bought and sold for sex. I stopped by the economy motel. It&#39;s where Deonte Johnson worked in 2021. The GBI says he not only bought a child for sex, but supplied a motel room as well. I. I don&#39;t know how long. 11 Alive confirmed Johnson&#39;s arrest comes a little more than a year after record show Mark Thomas was pulled over in Cherokee County. The connection? The attorney General&#39;s office says both men were exploiting the same teenage girl for sex. Investigators say they found the girl in the passenger seat of Mark Thomas&#39;s vehicle. That event launched a multi county investigation leading to the motel the AG&#39;s human Trafficking Prosecution Unit says they&#39;ve tracked down to sellers. Mark Thomas and Cedric Johnson. As of now, they&#39;ve identified 4 buyers between Cherokee and Fulton counties. The victim? Just 15 years old. Back at the Economy Motel, I not only informed the staff of Deonte Johnson&#39;s arrest, but questioned if they knew about his past. Up here as far as sleep now, now who&#39;s respective in there as well? Dionte Johnson&#39;s sex offender registry file shows he was convicted in 2011 of aggravated sexual battery. When you got high. Obviously somebody dropped the ball when they hired him. Now I have been actually highlighting the Attorney General&#39;s human Trafficking Prosecution unit over the last few weeks and this is a perfect example of how extensive these investigations are, how long they take and the outcome again from one traffic stop has landed 6 accused predators behind bars tonight.

With those new details from police, Joe, the suspect, was able to escape. Well that&#39;s right Jeff in Gwinnett County police tell us right now they&#39;re actively looking for that suspect is about 1/2 hour ago when police took down the crime scene tape around the parking lot behind me and investigators are still looking into this case though even though they have sensed it cleared out. We first learned about this shooting after several 11 alive viewers contacted us and then Gwinnett County police confirmed that there was a shooting here in this parking lot they were investigating. It&#39;s about 45 minutes ago, a black SUV you&#39;re seeing here what was towed away from the bars parking lot. We&#39;re told this is the victims vehicle as of right now. Police have not released the idea of a suspect. They&#39;re trying to verify certain facts I&#39;m told before doing that. No arrests, as we mentioned have been made and they are actively looking for the person that shot the victim. The person killed, we&#39;re told is a man approximately 40 years old. First responders rushed him to the hospital where he died. Police have not said if either person had been at the bar. They are calling this though a road rage incident. It took place around 7:00 tonight and here&#39;s a play by play from Gwinnett County police and what they say led up to the shooting. What we&#39;re gathering from witnesses and video footage, it appeared that the suspect was on a bicycle, the victim was in a vehicle, and at some point they made contact in the parking lot and an argument broke out from that point which led to the shooting. And as you heard there from Gwinnett County police, they are talking with witnesses. They&#39;ve also gathered video surveillance from this incident. They&#39;re going through all of that right now to hopefully get a better idea of what exactly led up to the shooting and then what played out afterwards. As soon as we get any information, any ID or description of that suspect from Gwinnett County police will put it for you on 11 alive.com.

You gotta stay alert out here in these streets, they say. Tamika Harris walked into the Marietta Kroger not knowing she was chosen as a target of a convicted felon. And as she was unloading her groceries, officers say he attacked. He ended up getting into her car, she wrestled with him, and eventually she fell loud as he took off.

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/11Alive/","Metro Atlanta Woman fights back after she was almost kidnapped at gunpoint outside a Kroger. This all happened in Marietta. This is right near the intersection of Delk and Powers Ferry Rd, which is considered a very busy area. 11 lives. Cody alcorn. You spoke with police and Cody, what do we know about this guy who tried to take this woman? Well, right now we can tell you Randy Harmon is a convicted felon. And listen to this. After police say he tried to kidnap the woman outside Kroger last week, he ditched her car and then was arrested the same night. In a different stolen vehicle. This isn&#39;t something that happens often, but on December 6th something did happen outside this Marietta Kroger 9 in the morning. On a Tuesday morning, on a busy intersection in the middle of all of this industry, Tamika Harris pulls into a parking spot. Little diseno that there&#39;s already a convicted felon who has backed into a spot and is looking for a victim. Once she walks inside, the convicted felon was seen on camera moving his car to be immediately next to her driver door to drive her door. Harris walks out, and as she&#39;s finishing unloading her groceries, officer Chuck Mcfillin me says the suspect attacked as she opens up her. Driver door to get in. She feels something jab into her side. It&#39;s a gun. He&#39;s forcing her over that center council. She has a choice. She fought him off. They wrestled over the weapon. He got into the car. He tried to accelerate in an attempt to kidnap her. She got the passenger door open and she fell out as he was speeding out of the parking lot. Harris&#39;s car was found a short time later, ditched in a nearby neighborhood, and not a single thing was missing. You have to ask yourself, if he wasn&#39;t after any of her belongings, then what did he want? Fortunately, Harris fought back. Thank God that she did, and thank God that she did things the way that she did, Officer Mcphilemy says while this crime is rare for their city, it&#39;s a good reminder it can happen to anyone at any time. But that&#39;s not a cause for fear. It&#39;s a request for just due diligence at situational awareness. As I mentioned, Randy Harmon was arrested the same night after Cobb County police got a hit on a flock camera alerting them of a stolen car. They tracked it down and arrested him. He&#39;s facing several felony charges now. As for Harris, she got a few bumps and bruises but was not seriously hurt.

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/11Alive/","New tonight, Cobb County is hoping to decrease crime by using facial recognition software. Community members have been a little critical of this technology in the past, but what are they saying about it now? 11 lives? Karis Belger has their reaction. One member of the Cobb County Public Safety Coalition wants to make sure there are limits to the software, and after last night&#39;s community meeting, Sally Riddle says her concerns are alleviated. For now. Understanding is that the contract will begin shortly, but that they still will not allow use of the software until the policy is fully implemented and trained on. Sally Riddle says she was concerned when she first heard about Cobb County using Clearview AI. Software to solve crimes. We wanted to make sure that there was a good control over who would get to use the software within the Police Department, Riddle says. She was also concerned about the software being used to misidentify people of color, and that it would be used to invade the privacy of everyday people when it could be used. To make sure that it wasn&#39;t the sole determining factor in whether someone was pursued for a crime, the Cobb County Police Department has been using the software. For the last seven months there were pilot program Chief Stuart Van Hooser says police use images that are uploaded from public images that are already available and the tool is working. The first time we ever used it, it was a newspaper article that solved a four year old homicide, 3 1/2 year old homicide. Van Hoosier also understands the public safety concerns, but says there would be limits to who could use it and what it would be used for. And if we can&#39;t develop information that the person did it, then we&#39;re not going to rely on that tip, if that makes sense. For now, Sally says she&#39;s not worried, but she hopes the Police Department will keep its word. Riddle mentioned she&#39;s also concerned there isn&#39;t a statewide regulation of facial recognition software. She&#39;s hoping to push lawmakers to look more closely at how tools like Clearview AI are used. You know, I know they&#39;re using it in China all the time. A lot different, of course, being here in America. But a lot of folks are concerned about the Big Brother aspect of that, being able to spy on your family or you as well. That&#39;s the opportunity cost there, you know. What are you giving up to get the protection, to get the crime solved. So there&#39;s a lot of discussion that&#39;s gonna be, I think had going forward as more and more technologies like this becomes available for sure.
