Poultry activities are allowed to resume statewide after a bird flu outbreak in northeast Georgia. 🐓

The ban was put in place last month after confirmed bird flu detection at two sites in Elbert County.  The suspension of all live poultry exhibitions, shows and sales is now lifted.  The Georgia Department of Agriculture says the two affected areas remain under quarantine until further notice.

“I’m excited to announce that both commercial poultry producers in the control area and poultry enthusiasts across our state can return to normal operations,” said Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler J Harper. “While this announcement is a great step in the right direction, HPAI remains a significant threat to our #1 industry, and the Georgia Department of Agriculture will continue working around the clock to protect our state’s flocks and to keep prices as low as possible for Georgia consumers.”

PAULDING COUNTY, GEORGIA - A Paulding County Superior Court judge sentenced a man to 475 years in prison for more than 100 dog fighting and animal cruelty charges.

Raid on Vincent Burrell's home

The backstory: In November 2022, investigators raided the property of Vincent Burrell.

Paulding County Assistant District Attorney and lead prosecutor on the case, K.C. Pagnotta, was there at the scene from day one of the investigation. ""Everywhere you looked, you couldn't take a step in any one direction without there being another pit bull staked out on a chain. And the purpose of doing that is dog fighting. They will put the pit bull out on a chain, and they space each dog out enough that they can see each other. They can agitate each other, but they can actually get to one another. And it's part of the building of aggression that they used to train fighting dogs,"" Pagnotta said.

She says all the dogs were malnourished and living in deplorable conditions. This included young Baby Shark, one of the dogs rescued from the property. ""She looks a lot better now, but if you can see, there's kind of her limbs come out and an angle, both of her front legs. That's because she developed rickets from poor nutrition, and also, the crate she was in was entirely too small. So, she wasn't able to stretch her legs and straighten them out like she's supposed to. And she actually had to have a series of casts on her front legs,"" Pagnotta said.

Historic dog fighting sentence

Dig deeper: On Monday, Burrell went to trial facing 93 counts of dog fighting and 10 counts of cruelty to animals. After a four-day trial, the jury found Burrell guilty on all counts. On Thursday, Paulding County Superior Court Judge Dean Bucci handed down the maximum sentence of 475 years in prison.  ""I kind of lost my breath a little bit,"" Pagnotta said when she heard the sentence.

She says it could possibly be the longest prison term for this type of offense in the nation’s history.  ""It's extremely rare. I was actually assisted in prosecuting this case by Jessica Rock. She works for the Prosecuting Attorney's Council of Georgia, and she's actually their animal resource prosecutor. So, she travels around the state helping counties, helping aides like myself prosecute these cases. And she also prosecutes animal fighting cases federally. And so, in talking with her, as far as she knows, this is the longest sentence for dog fighting that anyone has ever been given at the state or federal level,"" Pagnotta said.

What they're saying: Paulding County District Attorney Robert Lane says it sends a very clear message from his office. ""If you come to Paulding County and you engage in evil acts, we are going to make an example out of you,"" he said. 

Fighting animal cruelty in Georgia

Local perspective: Pagnotta says this case had been hidden in plain sight for years. ""My house isn't far from where the defendant lived. And the fact that he was able to operate this many dogs basically under our noses, it was shocking because the scene in his backyard was like nothing I could have ever imagined,"" she said.

She says this case is going to change that going forward by helping them identify similar operations. ""We know what we're looking for now. And I think that's going to help in any further cases we have that may include serious animal cruelty or dog fighting,"" Pagnotta said.

She also said going forward they can now coordinate more easily with other agencies.

In this case, she worked with the state’s Prosecuting Attorneys Council, the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office, and Marshals as well as special agents with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 

How to help end dog fighting

What you can do: The Paulding County DA’s office says the original tip came in from an Amazon driver, which highlights how important the concept of ""see something, say something"" is.

Shortly before midnight last night, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published its initial findings from a study it undertook last July when it asked eight large companies to turn over information about the data they collect about consumers, product sales, and how the surveillance the companies used affected consumer prices. The FTC focused on the middlemen hired by retailers. Those middlemen use algorithms to tweak and target prices to different markets.

The initial findings of the FTC using data from six of the eight companies show that those prices are not static. Middlemen can target prices to individuals using their location, browsing patterns, shopping history, and even the way they move a mouse over a webpage. They can also use that information to show higher-priced products first in web searches. The FTC found that the intermediaries—the middlemen—worked with at least 250 retailers.

“Initial staff findings show that retailers frequently use people’s personal information to set targeted, tailored prices for goods and services—from a person's location and demographics, down to their mouse movements on a webpage,” said FTC chair Lina Khan. “The FTC should continue to investigate surveillance pricing practices because Americans deserve to know how their private data is being used to set the prices they pay and whether firms are charging different people different prices for the same good or service.”

The FTC has asked for public comment on consumers’ experience with surveillance pricing.

FTC commissioner Andrew N. Ferguson, whom Trump has tapped to chair the commission in his incoming administration, dissented from the report. 

Matt Stoller of the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project, which is working “to address today’s crisis of concentrated economic power,” wrote that “[t]he antitrust enforcers (Lina Khan et al) went full Tony Montana on big business this week before Trump people took over.” 

Stoller made a list. The FTC sued John Deere “for generating $6 billion by prohibiting farmers from being able to repair their own equipment,” released a report showing that pharmacy benefit managers had “inflated prices for specialty pharmaceuticals by more than $7 billion,” “sued corporate landlord Greystar, which owns 800,000 apartments, for misleading renters on junk fees,” and “forced health care private equity powerhouse Welsh Carson to stop monopolization of the anesthesia market.” 

It sued Pepsi for conspiring to give Walmart exclusive discounts that made prices higher at smaller stores, “​​[l]eft a roadmap for parties who are worried about consolidation in AI by big tech by revealing a host of interlinked relationships among Google, Amazon and Microsoft and Anthropic and OpenAI,” said gig workers can’t be sued for antitrust violations when they try to organize, and forced game developer Cognosphere to pay a $20 million fine for marketing loot boxes to teens under 16 that hid the real costs and misled the teens.  

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau “sued Capital One for cheating consumers out of $2 billion by misleading consumers over savings accounts,” Stoller continued. It “forced Cash App purveyor Block…to give $120 million in refunds for fostering fraud on its platform and then refusing to offer customer support to affected consumers,” “sued Experian for refusing to give consumers a way to correct errors in credit reports,” ordered Equifax to pay $15 million to a victims’ fund for “failing to properly investigate errors on credit reports,” and ordered “Honda Finance to pay $12.8 million for reporting inaccurate information that smeared the credit reports of Honda and Acura drivers.”

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice sued “seven giant corporate landlords for rent-fixing, using the software and consulting firm RealPage,” Stoller went on. It “sued $600 billion private equity titan KKR for systemically misleading the government on more than a dozen acquisitions.”

“Honorary mention goes to [Secretary Pete Buttigieg] at the Department of Transportation for suing Southwest and fining Frontier for ‘chronically delayed flights,’” Stoller concluded. He added more results to the list in his newsletter BIG.

Meanwhile, last night, while the leaders in the cryptocurrency industry were at a ball in honor of President-elect Trump’s inauguration, Trump launched his own cryptocurrency. By morning he appeared to have made more than $25 billion, at least on paper. According to Eric Lipton at the New York Times, “ethics experts assailed [the business] as a blatant effort to cash in on the office he is about to occupy again.”

Adav Noti, executive director of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, told Lipton: “It is literally cashing in on the presidency—creating a financial instrument so people can transfer money to the president’s family in connection with his office. It is beyond unprecedented.” Cryptocurrency leaders worried that just as their industry seems on the verge of becoming mainstream, Trump’s obvious cashing-in would hurt its reputation. Venture capitalist Nick Tomaino posted: “Trump owning 80 percent and timing launch hours before inauguration is predatory and many will likely get hurt by it.”

Yesterday the European Commission, which is the executive arm of the European Union, asked X, the social media company owned by Trump-adjacent billionaire Elon Musk, to hand over internal documents about the company’s algorithms that give far-right posts and politicians more visibility than other political groups. The European Union has been investigating X since December 2023 out of concerns about how it deals with the spread of disinformation and illegal content. The European Union’s Digital Services Act regulates online platforms to prevent illegal and harmful activities, as well as the spread of disinformation. 

Today in Washington, D.C., the National Mall was filled with thousands of people voicing their opposition to President-elect Trump and his policies. Online speculation has been rampant that Trump moved his inauguration indoors to avoid visual comparisons between today’s protesters and inaugural attendees. Brutally cold weather also descended on President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, but a sea of attendees nonetheless filled the National Mall. 

Trump has always understood the importance of visuals and has worked hard to project an image of an invincible leader. Moving the inauguration indoors takes away that image, though, and people who have spent thousands of dollars to travel to the capital to see his inauguration are now unhappy to discover they will be limited to watching his motorcade drive by them. On social media, one user posted: “MAGA doesn’t realize the symbolism of [Trump] moving the inauguration inside: The billionaires, millionaires and oligarchs will be at his side, while his loyal followers are left outside in the cold. Welcome to the next 4+ years.” 

Trump is not as good at governing as he is at performance: his approach to crises is to blame Democrats for them. But he is about to take office with majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, putting responsibility for governance firmly into his hands. 

Right off the bat, he has at least two major problems at hand. 

Last night, Commissioner Tyler Harper of the Georgia Department of Agriculture suspended all “poultry exhibitions, shows, swaps, meets, and sales” until further notice after officials found Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or bird flu, in a commercial flock. As birds die from the disease or are culled to prevent its spread, the cost of eggs is rising—just as Trump, who vowed to reduce grocery prices, takes office. 

There have been 67 confirmed cases of the bird flu in the U.S. among humans who have caught the disease from birds. Most cases in humans are mild, but public health officials are watching the virus with concern because bird flu variants are unpredictable. On Friday, outgoing Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra announced $590 million in funding to Moderna to help speed up production of a vaccine that covers the bird flu. Juliana Kim of NPR explained that this funding comes on top of $176 million that Health and Human Services awarded to Moderna last July.  

The second major problem is financial. On Friday, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen wrote to congressional leaders to warn them that the Treasury would hit the debt ceiling on January 21 and be forced to begin using extraordinary measures in order to pay outstanding obligations and prevent defaulting on the national debt. Those measures mean the Treasury will stop paying into certain federal retirement accounts as required by law, expecting to make up that difference later.

Yellen reminded congressional leaders: “The debt limit does not authorize new spending, but it creates a risk that the federal government might not be able to finance its existing legal obligations that Congresses and Presidents of both parties have made in the past.” She added, “I respectfully urge Congress to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.”

Both the avian flu and the limits of the debt ceiling must be managed, and managed quickly, and solutions will require expertise and political skill. 

Rather than offering their solutions to these problems, the Trump team leaked that it intended to begin mass deportations on Tuesday morning in Chicago, choosing that city because it has large numbers of immigrants and because Trump’s people have been fighting with Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat. Michelle Hackman, Joe Barrett, and Paul Kiernan of the Wall Street Journal, who broke the story, reported that Trump’s people had prepared to amplify their efforts with the help of right-wing media.

But once the news leaked of the plan and undermined the “shock and awe” the administration wanted, Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan said the team was reconsidering it.", ,no longer populated,,2025-01-19T05:05:26.000Z,post data removed,,59548,25539,4121,0,,

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeAnd America's main problem is the dollar.Emmanuel Todd’s book: The Defeat of the WestThe dollar is ruining AmericaIn economics, there is a term ""the curse of natural resources"", which means a situation when their abundance in the country and export abroad hinder the development of other sectors of the economy. [This is what happened to Holland, which once exported large amounts of gas and oil, but when the deposits dwindled, the country initially had very little industry to fall back on. This economic problem became known as the “Dutch disease.” Holland has recovered since]https://tsargrad.tv/articles/prokljate-ameriki-nuland-i-blinken-mstjat-ukraine-za-svoih-dedushek_1111987Vladlen ChertinovThe Curse of America: Nuland and Blinken Take Revenge on Ukraine for Their GrandfathersThe war in Ukraine is bringing the end of America closer. This is the conclusion made by the French scientist and prophet Emmanuel Todd. He once accurately predicted the collapse of the USSR, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the ""Arab Spring"", and last year he wrote the book ""The Defeat of the West"" [La défaite de l’occident], which caused shock in the West. In his research, Todd paints a portrait of the United States as an incurably sick country. Having forgotten how to work and think, suffering from violence and obesity, becoming poorer and going crazy. And it all began in 2015 - when God was abolished in the United States. Since then, America, and along with it, its servants around the world, have been sucked into a ""black hole"".Sick CountryEmmanuel Todd is surprised that there are still many people who believe in the power of America. And in its democracy. They believe that in the conflict with Russia, it defends freedom and human rights. Although the facts say otherwise.Emanuel Todd predicted the collapse of the USSR, and now predicts the defeat of the West.The United States is a sick country with an increasing infant mortality rate, which in 2020 was 5.4 per 1,000 births (for comparison: in Russia it was 4.4).The average life expectancy in the United States is also declining: from 78.8 years in 2014 to 77.3 years in 2020 and 76.3 in 2021. While in Russia, ""still bearing the biological imprint of its tortured history,"" it grew by six years from 2002 to 2020 — from 65.1 to 71.3 years.But the most striking thing is that the rise in mortality in the United States was accompanied by the highest healthcare costs in the world — in 2020, they accounted for 18.8% of the country's GDP. The paradox is explained simply: part of this spending went... to the destruction of the population by pharmaceutical companies. No other country in the world takes so many drugs. With a population of 5% of all the inhabitants of the planet, Americans buy more than 50% of all drugs produced, some of which are the same drugs.The most rapidly ""dying"" part of the American population were white people aged 45-54 — residents of the internal ""Republican"" states. The reasons: alcoholism, suicide and drug addiction. They also became the main victims of the opioid scandal. Todd explains its essence:Large pharmaceutical companies, through the mediation of highly paid and unscrupulous doctors, provided patients suffering morally for economic and social reasons with dangerous painkillers that are addictive, very often leading to direct death, alcoholism or suicide.This can be compared to the destruction of excess population, disappointed with their lives, and with the economic and social situation in the country.In 2016, Congress, led by the pharmaceutical lobby, prohibited health authorities from suspending the use of ""medicinal opioids"", passing a law allowing the US pharmaceutical industry to continue killing its citizens.The United States is also the absolute leader in the world in mass shootings of some citizens by others and in the number of prisoners. Todd ironically remarks that in the ""freest country"", defending democracy from Russian ""autocracy"", more people are behind bars than anywhere else in the world.In 2019, the number of prisoners per million inhabitants in the United States was 531 people, compared to 300 in Russia. And I believe that by recruiting mercenaries in prisons, the Wagner Group had to lower this number.There is also such an indicator as the average duration of effective work. In 1961, it was 40 hours a week in the United States, and in 2003 - only 27.Todd also draws attention to the fact that America is getting dumber. Studies show a decline in intelligence between 2006 and 2018. This applies to both good and bad students from all ethnic groups.Between the two world wars, secondary school education was actively developing in America. As a result, by 1945, half of the world's industry was in the United States. After the war, it was the turn of universities, and a boom in higher education began. But after 1965, something went wrong.The US has a dual SAT system, one part assessing verbal skills, the other math skills. They deteriorated equally from 1965 to 1980. Then, until 2005, there was stabilization. Then the decline resumed. The level of industrial production was also falling. By 2019, it was already 16.8% of the world's. In 2020, only 7.2% of American students received an engineering education. For comparison: in Russia - 23.4%. With half the population (146 versus 330 million), our country [the author is Russian] managed to train significantly more engineers than America..As Engels and Lenin predicted, free trade corrupts, but we can add: absolute free trade corrupts absolutely... Neither Engels nor Lenin could have imagined that the Western proletariat could be completely transformed into commoners, living mainly on the labor of the Chinese and other peoples of the world. The transfer of many manufacturing plants abroad contributed to the increasing exhaustion of our provinces and suburbs, turning the productive citizen into a parasitic plebeian, who hardly wants to return to the right path in his heart.The life of a parasitic plebeian is tragic. Todd writes that American workers, realizing their declining social usefulness, turn to alcoholism and drugs, commit suicide, or vote for Trump. And American youth are becoming less and less willing to work and study.Jews are declining along with AmericaThe share of white Americans in higher education in the United States is declining. They are underrepresented even at the most prestigious universities that allow one to join the elite. Todd uses Harvard, Yale and Princeton as examples. While whites make up 61% of the population in the US, they make up only 46% at these three universities. Also less than it could be, based on the composition of the population, blacks and Hispanics.Asians demonstrate the greatest thirst for knowledge. With a total of 6% of the US population, they make up 28% at these three universities! Todd explains this by the fact that the children of immigrants from Japan, Korea, China and Vietnam were protected from the general American ""shipwreck"" for one or two generations by the still-existing family values ​​and Confucian tradition, for which education was almost sacred.Even Jews are drowning in the American quagmire. Among Harvard students, their number has decreased from 25% to less than 10%. And in the eight most prestigious universities (the so-called Ivy League), Jews make up only 7% - less than the quota that was once introduced for them. [US universities once had a legal quota for Jews]Todd cites an article from 2023 in the book, whose author, analyzing the ""catastrophic"" state of Jewry in the United States, notes:In academic circles in Hollywood, Washington, and even New York, wherever American Jews have managed to establish themselves, their influence has sharply weakened.For example, with a total share of Jews of 1.7% of the entire US population, they used to make up 20% of federal judges, but now only 7%. Among scientists born between 1944 and 1967, their share was 21%, but among current scientists under 30 - only 4%.If this were to happen in Russia, our government would have long been accused of state anti-Semitism! In the US, of course, there can be no talk of any persecution of Jews: in 2010, according to the Forbes rating, they made up 30% of the top hundred richest people in the country - that same oligarchic elite. Jews are simply deteriorating along with America.But Emmanuel Todd, by the way, emphasizing his own Jewish roots, draws attention to an interesting nuance. Despite the fact that in the US the number of Jews is greatly declining in all their traditional spheres of activity, there are a lot of them in the Biden administration, especially among those involved in foreign policy.For example, on the Board of Directors of the most prestigious foreign policy think tank - the Council on Foreign Relations: almost a third of its 34 members are Jews... In the current ruling group, and especially in the faction engaged in war, Americans of Jewish origin are still overrepresented, says Todd. Moreover, these are not just Jews, but people whose ancestors came from Tsarist Russia and its outskirts. The scientist points to the two most influential figures who, in his words, ""run"" Ukraine - Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland.It turns out that Blinken's paternal grandfather was born in Kyiv. In Victoria Nuland's paternal house, we see a combination of Moldovan and Ukrainian Jews... The fact that so many people in the top geopolitical establishment have family ties to the western part of the former Tsarist empire cannot but worry, Todd concludes. [Western Ukraine has always been a hotbed of Neonazism, and, ironically, Jews were and are heavily represented among this end of the political spectrum. For example, Zelensky is Jewish but seems not to care the Ukrainian folk hero Stepan Bandera once killed about 100,000 Jews in Lvov. Bandera’s birthday is an official celebration in Ukraine]It is clear that the goal of this [US State Department] establishment is the demographic exhaustion of Russia. But it is also clear that the price for this exhaustion will be the destruction of Ukraine. Todd believes that American Jews of Ukrainian descent have no attachment to Ukraine - a country where their ancestors were subjected to anti-Semitic persecution. And he comes close to the question: are the descendants of the once persecuted Ukrainian Jews, ""together with the Kyiv government managing this slaughter,"" taking revenge in such a sophisticated way on the country ""that caused so much suffering to their ancestors""?[In this context, let me recommend the article: How Jewish is the war on Russia?]If so, then this is some kind of Old Testament vengefulness.The ""Titanic"" can no longer turn backThe war in Ukraine has exposed the weaknesses of the United States. Todd notes, by the way, that the nature of the military actions is absolutely consistent with American parasitic globalism:We forced workers in low-wage countries to produce what we needed; we forced Ukraine, a country where the human body is cheap, to wage the war we needed.But America was unable to even wage such a parasitic war. It turned out that the United States is not capable of producing the weapons that Ukraine needs.The strengths of the American economy are information technology and oil and gas: Silicon Valley and Texas. And the rest of the industry is in decline. The war revealed the inability of the United States to produce the required number of shells, missiles and other weapons. In 2022, Russia's GDP was only 8.8% of the US GDP. How, despite this imbalance in their favor, did the United States get to the point where they can no longer produce enough shells for Ukraine? - Todd asks. And so he answers:The U.S. gross domestic product is overwhelmingly made up of services to people whose effectiveness or even usefulness is not always discernible: doctors (sometimes murderers, as we saw with opioids), overrated lawyers, predatory financiers, prison guards, drug enforcement agents, intelligence agencies. In 2020, the GDP even included as value-added the labor of the country's 15,140 economists - the ""high priests of lies"" with an average annual salary of $121,000. What is U.S. GDP worth if you separate it from the activities of this parasitic mass?Todd compares U.S. GDP to the Nobel Prize in economics - a rattle given to comedians. He argues that American GDP - $76,000 per capita in 2022 - is only 20% consistent with the ""physical"" sectors: industry, construction, transport, agriculture (by the way, grain production in the US fell from 65 million tons in 1980 to 47 million in 2022 and is teetering on the brink of deficit, while in Russia it grew from 37 million in 2012 to 104 million in 2023). That 20% of $76,000 translates into $15,200, or slightly more than Russia’s GDP ($10,420 in 2024).The drama of the American oligarchy is that it rules a decaying and largely fictitious economy, Todd believes.In the 1980s, the U.S. defense industry employed 3.2 million people; today, it employs only 1.1 million. Modern warfare is technological; most officers in the military should essentially be engineers. But there is an acute shortage of them.The brain drain to law and business schools threatens U.S. military might. Todd writes that war cannot be won by sending injunctions to the enemy or blocking his accounts. But that is exactly what America does. Imposing sanctions, freezing the assets of the Bank of Russia, seizing the property of Russians, refusing to insure ships— Emmanuel Todd has the feeling that the American side is waging war with lawyers, and Ukraine is short of ammunition.The scientist believes that the American ship can no longer be turned around. The Titanic is doomed to sail toward its iceberg. The point of no return was America's rejection of God. However, Todd, as a scientist, does not operate with this concept. He discusses the rejection of Christianity and even specifically Protestantism, on the principles of which America was founded. Its strengths were the cultivation of hard work and a desire for education in people.America and EmptinessFrom 1945 to 1965, America was ruled by a homogeneous, united elite that preserved the best qualities of Protestantism. It, like the rest of the population, obeyed the general morality, and conducted a responsible foreign policy aimed at protecting freedom. But then there was a breakdown in morality - the Anglo-American sexual revolution and the French May of 1968.[May 68 (French : Mai 68) refers to a period of civil unrest that occurred throughout France from May to June 1968. Beginning in May 1968, a period of civil unrest occurred throughout France, lasting seven weeks and punctuated by demonstrations, general strikes, and the occupation of universities and factories. At the height of events the economy of France came to a halt. – Wikipedia]Since then, Protestantism, which for centuries had been the engine of America's economic power, has been slowly dying. [Evangelicalism, based on a peculiar doctrine that deviates from Jesus’ peace and love teachings, has also taken a Zionist turn that is supporting Netanyahu’s genocide]Religious decay has led to the disappearance of social morality and sense of belonging to society. The ruling elite of the world's largest power no longer determines its actions and decisions in accordance with higher values. Today, it is nothing more than a gathering of people completely devoid of common moral principles. The very principle of keeping commitments has become something outdated and negative. Betrayal has become the norm. The complete disappearance of the Christian substrate explains the disintegration of the ruling classes of America.This ultimately led to global upheavals in the world. Emmanuel Todd characterizes the 2000s as the period of the actual end of Christianity in the West. He calls 2015 the year of zero religion, when same-sex marriages were legalized at the federal level in the United States.The scientist calls this an irreversible cultural shift, because homosexuality is condemned by all world religions. But the state of zero religion is not the end. Having crossed zero, America went into the minus and is going further and further along the path of denying reality. The road of lies.The United States, together with England, was the driving force behind a whole chain of revolutions - liberal, sexual, and then ""gender"", which, having begun with the fight for gender equality, ended with the fight for the freedom of transgender people.Genetics tells us that it is impossible to turn a man (XY chromosomes) into a woman (XX chromosomes) and vice versa. To pretend that this is not so means to state a lie, says Todd.Denial of reality and the fight against it has become central to America. In everything - from transgender people to the economy and the conflict with Russia. For the upper classes of the USA, the need to affirm the false, to worship it and to impose it as truth on society has become predominant. They lie like they breathe.Todd writes that a cult of lies has begun to be established in America. He does not operate with the concept of ""the devil"". But if we call things by their proper names, then what is happening is pure Satanism. According to the definition of Jesus Christ, the devil is the ""father of lies"". Having betrayed God, Americans inevitably began to serve Satan.The greatest illusion of these upheavals was the belief that the individual will become greater when freed from the collective. The opposite is true. A person can be great only in and through the community. Alone, he is doomed by his nature to shrink. Now that we are freeing ourselves en masse from metaphysical beliefs, we experience emptiness and shrink in size; this is how Todd described the mechanism of the crisis of the West.The end of the union of madmenThe USA is the world champion not only in the number of prisoners in prisons, but also in the number of obese people. From 2000 to 2020, the number of overweight residents there increased from 30.5% to 41.9% of the total population. Excess weight is a risk factor for many diseases, such as COVID. But obesity, according to Todd, is not only a medical problem, but also an indicator of the mental state of society.In a society where, despite inequality, it is not difficult to feed oneself, obesity indicates a lack of self-control (especially among the rich who can afford quality food) and a violation of the superego on a societal scale.In other words, the obesity of Americans is one of the signs of America's inadequacy. And from inadequacy it is not far to mental disorders.70% of all Americans are on prescription drugs (including 15% of high school students who abuse them), and someone in America dies from an accidental overdose every 19 minutes. 30 million, or almost 10% of the population, regularly take antidepressants, among them every fourth is a woman aged 40 to 60. Antidepressants are one of the causes of suicide and the increasing number of mass shootings.The superego is broken in all of America. Its separation from reality has gone too far. One of the key moments of this separation was the US victory in the Cold War. But Russia became the bone on which America slipped.At first, after the collapse of the USSR, the US did not know what to do with us. Todd writes that in the minds of Americans, Russia ceased to exist as an autonomous player, became a subordinate partner whose fate had yet to be determined. But Russia fell very quickly and in 1994-1998 it hit rock bottom. It lost the First Chechen War. After the default of 1998, its GDP reached a minimum. And this weakness, according to Todd, led America to the decision to deliver the final knockout blow. Since 1999, the United States has entered a state of arrogance. For the first time in its history, it no longer had an enemy. Overwhelmed by this emptiness, it lost its mind. This year, NATO began to expand eastward. That year, NATO bombed Serbia. That year, the American military budget began to increase again after the end of the Cold War. And the United States was close to taking control of Russia's mineral wealth through oligarchs like Khodorkovsky under its control.But in 1999, what Emmanuel Todd calls the irony of history happened: Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia. The country began to recover, and the rise was as fast as the fall. So fast that the United States, blinded by its own arrogance, did not immediately react to it. Moreover, as Todd writes, they considered themselves so invincible that they made another strategic mistake: in December 2001, they forced China to join the WTO, which would undermine their economy.Meanwhile, the Second Chechen War showed that Russia was not going to disintegrate, and Putin’s removal of the oligarchs from power and the arrest of Khodorkovsky [by Russia] in 2003, who was associated with Exxon Mobil, meant the failure of the United States’ attempt to get its hands on our oil and gas industry.In 2007, at the Munich Security Conference, Putin finally broke free - he gave a speech in which he declared that Russia would not accept the American unipolar world. In response, in early 2008, Georgia and Ukraine were invited to join NATO, in full accordance with the precepts of the Russophobe Brzezinski, who believed that the only way to finish off Russia was to amputate Ukraine. Todd calls this the apogee of American arrogance. And then, according to him, the Gods blinded America:[Putin's 2007 Munich speech. You will understand why he was never invited back]The United States began to dig a trap from which they will no longer be able to escape... There is no Russian factor destabilizing the world balance. There is an incurable crisis of the West, the peripheral waves of which have crashed onto the breakwater of resistance - Russia.The West is self-destructing, and its defeat is certain for Todd. The original values ​​that made America strong - Christianity, morality, work ethic and a sense of responsibility - have evaporated. And this is irreversible. The economic decline seems to be irreversible too.America produces almost nothing anymore. It has destroyed its own working class. But it has also lost its ruling class. Todd believes America no longer knows where it is going, it makes decisions in a distorted consciousness based on a distorted vision.These decisions have ceased to be rational and moral. The war in Ukraine is the result of the merger of two madnesses - American and Ukrainian. As a result, the Ukrainian people will die a martyr's death, and the Americans will see the fall of their empire.The defeat for the United States will be the de-dollarization of the world, the cessation of imports and great poverty. The loss of control over its external resources will lead to a decline in the standard of living of the population, which is already low.Already today, many Americans cannot afford to rent housing. Working full time and receiving a salary, they live on the street - in their cars or in tents. And it will be even worse.Emmanuel Todd believes that if there are still real Protestants left in the United States, then, observing what is happening to their country, they will probably often repeat the words of Jesus Christ ""fall from grace.""

Among the targets is a military airfield in Kyiv[Both the Iskander and the Kinzhal are hypersonic]Rogov reported a massive missile strike by the Russian Armed Forces on UkraineAlina GoncharovaAlina Goncharova (editor of the operational information department)This morning, the Russian Armed Forces launched massive strikes on military facilities and energy infrastructure in Ukraine. The start of the strike was announced by the chairman of the commission of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation on sovereignty issues, co-chairman of the coordinating council for the integration of new regions Vladimir Rogov.The strike has been carried out since five in the morning. According to Mash, a total of 120 missiles have been launched. According to available data, the Russian army used Iskanders, Gerans and Kinzhals. Explosions were heard in Kyiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkov, Odessa, Vinnytsia, Cherkasy and other regions of Ukraine. In Kyiv and other regions, emergency power outages began amid missile strikes. Energy Minister German Galushchenko said that the energy system of the entire Ukraine is under threat, three stages of power outages have been introduced, and there may be no power for up to 12 hours. The head of the Lviv regional military administration, Maksym Kozitsky, also reported on strikes on energy facilities in the region.Among the targets is a military airfield in KyivThe Russian Armed Forces have preliminarily launched strikes in the direction of an airfield in Kyiv, where F-16 fighter pilots are trained. Explosions were also heard in the area of ​​a drone manufacturing and helicopter repair plant in the suburbs of Boryspil. There was also a report of a possible strike on an airfield in Chuguev, Kharkiv region.Among other things, the coordinator of the pro-Russian Mykolaiv resistance, Sergei Lebedev, said that the strike was likely carried out on the port in Odessa. The city's mayor, Gennady Trukhanov, reported explosions amid an air raid alert. The Russian army also struck a military airfield in Starokostiantyniv in the Khmelnytsky region, presumably hitting an underground warehouse. Lebedev, citing resistance from Starokostiantyniv, said that ""the explosion felt very powerful, it was felt in houses on the other side of the city."" Despite regular strikes on the airfield, the Ukrainian military continues to use it. One of the targets could also be a military unit of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Nikolaev region. ""It looks like a military unit on Bugskikh, but the Martynovsky airfield also looks like it,"" the underground reported.Thanks for reading Don’s Substack!

I also supported passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024. WRDA is not only crucial to maintaining America’s vital waterways, but it will also create jobs. The projects supported help keep our communities safe, boost local economies by making our waterways more accessible to Georgians and visitors from across the country, and ensure our ports – like the Port of Savannah – remain thriving gateways of commerce and trade for Georgia’s businesses, including our agriculture industry.

CNN reported earlier Saturday that Trump was expected to pick Rollins, after initially being poised to offer the post to businesswoman and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler. CNN reported Friday that Trump was poised to offer the post to businesswoman and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago on Friday afternoon. There had been several discussions between Loeffler and the transition team regarding the position. But Trump held off from announcing his Agriculture pick as he issued a slew of others Friday night, raising questions about whether Loeffler was ultimately offered the post. Tracking Trump’s picks for his Cabinet and administration Rollins is the CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group with close ties to Trump’s transition team, and has been a vocal supporter of the president-elect. She congratulated Trump following his election win earlier this month, saying in a post on X, “We love you, Mr. President, and we are so proud to continue the battle for an America built around your America First vision.” Rollins’ name had previously been floated as a potential White House chief of staff. But Rollins stood down after it became clear that seeking the role would amount to a serious power struggle with Susie Wiles, who was ultimately named for the position. Rollins told the transition team that Agriculture secretary would be another role she would be interested in, one source familiar said. Trump and Rollins spoke this week about the role. “As our next Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke will spearhead the effort to protect American Farmers, who are truly the backbone of our Country,” Trump said in his statement Saturday. “Congratulations Brook!” In Trump’s first term, Rollins served as White House Domestic Policy Council director.

They do so in the face of many challenges, including unfairly priced imports and market volatility due to extreme weather events and natural disasters. This commitment by the Administration is a monumental investment that will help protect our specialty crop growers for years to come.

Specifically, the new Marketing Assistance for Specialty Crops initiative will provide $2 billion to assist specialty crop growers in maintaining a strong domestic supply and expanding market opportunities for their crops.

Affected Residents in These Counties may Pre-register Through D-SNAP Portal Beginning Oct. 26

Atlanta, GA – Georgians in areas hit hardest by Hurricane Helene can pre-register for assistance to feed their families under a temporary program called the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) supported by the Georgia Department of Human Services’ (DHS) Division of Family & Children Services (DFCS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). D-SNAP will be run in four phases. Phase 2 will begin on Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024, in South Georgia and will run through Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, excluding Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024. Future phases will include counties declared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Individual and Public Assistance at the time of disaster. 
D-SNAP provides temporary food assistance in the form of a one-time payment to low-to-moderate income households who lost income or sustained property damage following a disaster. To qualify for D-SNAP, Georgians must:

• Live or work in one of the counties declared by FEMA for Individual and Public Assistance at the time of the disaster
• Not currently receive food assistance through the regular SNAP program
• Have suffered a disaster-related loss to property or income, including incurring expenses related to the disaster
• Provide proof of identity for the head of household and authorized representative (if applicable)
• Meet financial eligibility requirements

Current SNAP recipients are not eligible for D-SNAP and should not apply.

Completing Pre-Registration for D-SNAP
Households who live or work in Phase 2 counties may pre-register only during their designated disaster benefit period and may be asked to provide additional proof to determine eligibility. Early pre-registration for Phase 2 households will begin on Saturday, Oct. 26, 2024, and end on Monday, Oct. 28, 2024. Pre-registration will continue through the duration of Phase 2. Paper applications will also be available at D-SNAP sites. 

The pre-registration form can be found on gateway.ga.gov. Applicants will need to create an account to pre-register. 

Households may pre-register with just their name, address, and signature at any point during pre-registration by clicking on the ""Sign & Submit"" button. However, DHS encourages applicants to answer as many questions as they can before submitting the pre-registration form. 

Households should be prepared to provide the following information: 

• Name, date of birth, and Social Security number (if applicable) for each household member
• Permanent residential address, temporary address, and/or mailing address
• Proof of identification, such as a driver's license or state-issued ID
• Amount of disaster-related expenses incurred during the disaster period
• Amount of income for each household member
• Amount of household resources, to include cash on hand or savings

Pre-registering for D-SNAP online is only the first step. Households must also complete an interview to determine their eligibility and finalize the D-SNAP application process. Households must be represented by either the head of household or an authorized representative.
 
Eligibility for the program requires an in-person or telephonic interview. Georgians must complete the in-person interview at a designated D-SNAP site, send an authorized representative to do so, or complete the interview over the phone. 

To pre-register and complete a telephonic interview, D-SNAP applicants who live or work in the Phase 2 counties can call 833-DSNAP-GA (833-376-2742) beginning Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024. The D-SNAP Virtual Call Center will operate Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 

To manage call volume and in-person wait times, Phase 2 applicants are asked to call or visit a D-SNAP site location on the below assigned day based on their last name:
• Oct. 29, 2024: A-F
• Oct. 30, 2024: G-L

Governor Brian Kemp has suspended the gas tax as of yesterday.  This will save you about .30 cents per gallon of gas and about .33 cents per gallon of diesel.

Both Cook and Colquitt are eligible for FEMA Individual Assistance and Public Assistance.  As far as individual assistance, in most cases, your insurance will be primary coverage and the individual assistance can cover any gaps.  Find more info at https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual. It outlines eligibility and criteria.  There will likely be more information coming on this topic so please keep it on your radar screen.

While still determining Ag commodity damages locally and to the east of us, there are some things in the works from U.S. Department of Agriculture, Georgia Department of Agriculture, and other agencies.  Check with your local FSA offices for more information; most of it will be to the benefit of our growers and producers.  Appreciate the work of our Ag Commissioner Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and Georgia Forestry Commission, and others in spotlighting the amount of unprecedented damage to our state's top industry.  There will likely be more updates on this at the state level in the near future as well.

There are still a good many of our citizens without power.  In the past on military deployments, I have lived for several weeks without power or running water but that was in a combat zone.  From what I have seen and heard, the conditions for our neighbors east of us are very similar.  I know from speaking to them directly that our utility companies are at the edge of their capabilities and are doing all they can to get power back. Updates are available at Colquitt Electric Membership Corporation, Georgia Power, and your city utility departments.

Thank you to all the private, non-profit, public, and neighbor to neighbor assistance that is going on, seen and unseen. It has been an inspiration to us. #Helene", ,no longer populated,,2024-10-04T16:17:32.000Z,post data removed,,53,19,7,0,,

Yesterday, I approved 100% percent federal cost share for emergency response activities in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina. This will cover the costs for the urgent work to remove debris; surge additional first responders and search and rescue teams; set up shelters; and provide food and clean water.

U.S. Department of Agriculture is on the ground to support farmers, ranchers, and small businesses impacted by the storm. And FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency is knocking doors to register folks to receive financial assistance.

To date, more than $20 million in Individual Assistance has been provided to thousands of survivors who have been affected by Hurricane Helene and FEMA has shipped over 9.3 million meals, more than 11.2 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 260,000 tarps to the region.", ,no longer populated,,2024-10-03T23:05:01.000Z,post data removed,,8940,1023,3542,0,,

When Hurricane Helene came through, she decided she liked Moses Pecans and took them with her. We are at a 80% total tree loss across all orchards. Our younger (10 and under) orchards seemed to weather the storm better and that is our 20% left but as we all know they will not produce for another few years. 

But on a much brighter note, Commissioner Tyler Harper is the definition of boots on the ground, ""What can we do?"". He visited the farm today to help assess damage and start advocating for farmers in our area. We can't thank him enough, in a time like this it means a lot to see him out doing everything he can.  And in the words of Governor Kemp, all we can do now is ""Keep Plowing"".

FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration’s Continued Response Efforts to Hurricane Helene
 
Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership, the Administration is continuing to provide robust and well-coordinated Federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts to Hurricane Helene’s impacts. The President and Vice President are closely monitoring these efforts and receive regular updates from their teams.
 
At the President’s direction, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell visited Florida over the weekend to assess damage alongside local and state officials. She continued surveying damage today in parts of Georgia before she moves into North Carolina on Monday.

Throughout the end of last week and all weekend, Administrator Criswell and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall briefed President Biden on the ongoing impacts of Hurricane Helene in multiple states, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia. Administrator Criswell also updated the President on Federal actions to support response and recovery.  

The President directed Administrator Criswell to determine what more can be done to accelerate support to those who are having the most difficult time accessing assistance in isolated communities. He also advised the FEMA Administrator that as soon as it will not disrupt emergency response operations, he intends to travel this week to impacted communities.

Additionally, the Federal government is closely monitoring an additional weather disturbance in the Caribbean Sea that has the potential to form into another storm in the coming week. Residents throughout the Gulf Coast should remain alert, listen to local officials, and make additional preparations as needed.
 
Additional Federal response actions include:
 
Approving Major Disaster Declarations:
Saturday, President Biden approved Major Disaster declarations for the states of Florida and North Carolina, allowing survivors to immediately access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery. People in 17 counties in Florida and 25 counties in North Carolina, including the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, can now apply for assistance with FEMA. People can apply in three ways: online by visiting disasterassistance.gov, calling 1-800-621-3362 or on the FEMA App.
 
FEMA assistance in Florida and North Carolina may include upfront funds to help with essential items like food, water, baby formula, and other emergency supplies. Funds may also be available to repair storm-related damage to homes and personal property, as well as assistance to find a temporary place to stay.
 
Emergency declarations were also approved for Florida, North Carolina Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama. Under an emergency declaration, FEMA provides direct Federal support to states for life saving activities and other emergency protective measures, such as evacuation, sheltering, and search and rescue.
 
Supporting On-The-Ground Response Efforts:
As of yesterday, more than 3,300 personnel from across the Federal workforce were deployed and supporting Hurricane Helene response efforts across the impacted states. This includes the most experienced incident management teams to help identity Federal resources to address unmet needs, as well as Urban Search and Rescue personnel using high water rescue equipment for rescue missions across the region. 
 
At least 50,000 personnel from 31 states and the District of Columbia and Canada are responding to power outages and working around the clock throughout parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to restore power to those communities that can receive power. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is moving generators and additional power generation assets into the hardest hit areas of South and North Carolina as flood waters recede and debris removal allows. As of yesterday afternoon, approximately 2.3 million customers were without power, down from the region-wide peak of 4.6 million on September 27.
 
Additional Interagency Support Efforts:
Together with state and local partners, the Federal government is actively supporting Hurricane Helene response efforts and is coordinating requests for Federal assistance.

FEMA distribution centers are fully stocked and ready to provide commodities and equipment to any impacted state, as required.
 
FEMA is trucking dozens of trailers containing food and water in North Carolina to support the State as they start to set up care-sites for survivors.
 
FEMA is also working with the Federal Communications Commission and private sector telecommunications partners to deploy emergency mobile communications assets while they work to restore network services, particularly in remote areas.
 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a Public Health Emergency for Florida and Georgia, giving health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. About 200 medical responders are in Florida, Alabama, and North Carolina, along with medical equipment and supplies, to help ensure the delivery of health care services following the landfall of Hurricane Helene.
 
Twenty-four federal Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces are deployed across the affected regions. Roughly 1,302 Urban Search and Rescue personnel are assisting in the impacted areas. Together with local and state responders, teams have rescued and supported over 1,400 of people across the impacted area.
 
The U.S. Coast Guard has thousands of personnel working on response efforts and are conducting post-storm assessments to support the rapid reopening of impacted ports.
 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deployed teams for temporary emergency power, debris removal, and infrastructure assessment, including for dams throughout the region.
 
The Environmental Protection Agency has personnel on the ground who are offering technical assistance and guidance on water systems, debris management, and maintaining critical public health and environmental protections in place as storm impacts are assessed.
 
The U.S. Small Business Administration deployed more than 50 personnel to support survivors and small businesses as they recover from the hurricane.
 
The U.S. Department of Energy has responders deployed across the region and are closely monitoring power, fuel, and supply chain interruptions.
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency has deployed personnel to the impacted region to extend much-needed emergency credit to farmers and agriculture producers who lost crops and livestock.

Late Friday night, Tennessee House Republican Caucus chair Jeremy Faison posted “President Biden has finally approved [Tennessee governor Bill Lee’s] state of emergency request,” making it sound as if the delay in federal support for the state during the devastation of Hurricane Helene was Biden’s fault. In fact, while Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina all declared emergencies and requested and received federal approval of those declarations before the hurricane hit, Governor Lee did not. 

Instead, in keeping with an April joint resolution from the Republican-dominated Tennessee legislature calling for 31 days of prayer and fasting to “seek God’s hand of mercy healing on Tennessee,” Lee proclaimed September 27 “a voluntary Day of Prayer & Fasting.”

Lee did not declare a state of emergency until late on September 27, after flash flooding had already created havoc. President Biden approved it immediately.  

The extraordinary damage from Helene in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia continues to mount. At least 91 people have died, and search and rescue teams are at work across several states. More than 2 million people are without power, and western North Carolina is isolated after its roads washed out. A fire at a chemical facility in Conyers, Georgia, outside Atlanta forced the evacuation of 17,000 people nearby. The National Weather Service office in Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, wrote to the residents of the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia: “This is the worst event in our office’s history.”  

Faison’s implication that Democratic president Biden, rather than Republican governor Lee, was to blame for the slow federal response to Helene in Tennessee illustrated the Republicans’ attempt to create a fake world to motivate their base with fear and anger while leaving Democrats to come up with real world solutions. And since those solutions are popular, Republicans are claiming credit for them. 

In the past two days, Republican lawmakers who just days ago voted against funding the federal government and who have railed against government spending have been out front claiming credit for getting federal disaster relief.  

Republican presidential nominee Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio senator J.D. Vance have been claiming that it was Trump who capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. Vance has accused Vice President Kamala Harris of lying when the Biden administration takes credit for it. Vance’s statement, itself, is a breathtaking lie. Trump signed an executive order in July 2020 establishing a temporary, voluntary program that let some Medicare Part D prescription drug plans cap monthly insulin copayments at $35. The program ran from January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. 

The Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in August 2022, required all Part D plans to charge no more than $35 a month for all covered insulin products. All Democrats in the House and the Senate voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, and all Republicans—including J.D. Vance—voted against it. 

As Republicans have lost the support of suburban women for their attacks on reproductive rights and embrace of the misogyny of the MAGA movement, they have tried to beef up the idea that they are the country’s true supporters of women and families. Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, has been trying to assure women: “I want to be your protector. As president, I have to be your protector.” With him back in office, he said at a rally in Pennsylvania, women “will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.”

Journalist Jessica Valenti noted that antiabortion activists are running advertisements blaming the deaths of women in states with abortion bans not on those bans or those who passed them, but on the Democrats trying to protect reproductive healthcare. Women have died when doctors would not give them lifesaving care out of concerns about prosecution under states’ abortion bans or were unable to access abortion care. But the ads, using the names and images of women who have died under antiabortion regimes, claim that lifesaving care is still legal but doctors don’t know they can use it because of misinformation from pro-choice activists.

Antiabortion Republican Derrick Anderson, who is running to represent Virginia’s seventh congressional district, has appeared in campaign photographs with a woman and children posed as if they are his family, but they are not. He is unmarried and childless, and the family is that of a friend. 

That last one is really weird, but the biggest lies from the Republicans concern immigration, especially as voters blame the Republicans for killing a strong bipartisan border bill earlier this year after Trump demanded they keep the issue open for him to campaign on. J.D. Vance was among those who voted against it. 

There were the lies Vance spread about Springfield, Ohio, of course, attacking the legal Haitian immigrants there who have been credited with revitalizing the city. On Friday and Saturday, Trump lied that Vice President Harris had let 13,000 or 14,000 convicted murderers enter the U.S. in the past three years, who “freely and openly roam our country,” a lie that Elon Musk called “true.” 

In fact, as CNN’s Daniel Dale pointed out, it is a lie. The Department of Homeland Security clarified that the data to which Trump appeared to refer lists individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years—including during his own term—committed crimes in the U.S. rather than their country of origin, and either are currently incarcerated or have served their sentences but can’t be deported because their country of origin won’t accept them. Such individuals are monitored. 

On Saturday, Julia Terruso of the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that a woman in a Philadelphia suburb received a letter that looked like an official document from the fake “Pennsylvania Congressional Office of Immigration Affairs” telling her that she was expected to provide living space to five migrants under a program “written into Law by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.” 

As Terruso wrote, “No office exists, nor does such a government-mandated housing program, but the letter, doctored to look like an official government document, provided specific details designed to mislead someone less attuned to a scam—and laid the blame for the fake program at the feet of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during a heated and close election in which immigration has increasingly become a focal point.”

Lies establish dominance over people being lied to, because lies take away a person’s right to make good decisions about their own life. So what’s the purpose of the Republican lies? 

Former president Trump is the Republican presidential nominee, but his recent attacks on special counsel Jack Smith and his attempts to sell watches for up to $100,000 apiece suggest he is interested mostly in avoiding prosecution and gathering donations. At his recent events he is slurring his words, unable to answer questions, and seems consumed with anger and a desire for revenge against those he sees as his enemies. He has recently referred to Harris as “mentally disabled,” and today in Erie, Pennsylvania, he said that crime would end “if you had one really violent day…. One rough hour. And I mean real rough. The word will get out and it will end immediately.”  

He has, though, focused on painting a picture of the U.S. as a hellscape overrun with undocumented criminal immigrants. Journalist Aaron Rupar of Public Notice, who clips Trump’s speeches on social media, compared yesterday’s rally in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, to the “Two Minutes Hate” against political enemies in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Trump’s attacks on immigrants were so extreme even he admitted “this is a dark speech.” 

Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance is also doubling down on anti-immigrant attacks. In that, they are echoing the language Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán used to get voters to support him out of fear of immigrants. Then Orbán took control of Hungary, undermined its democracy, and set himself up as a dictator.  

Once in charge, Orbán insisted that democracy was obsolete. The democratic principle that the law must treat everyone equally and give them a say in their government, he said, weakens a nation by treating women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and racial, ethnic, and religious minorities as equal to white, heterosexual men. Immigration weakens a nation by diluting its purity. He set out to establish what he called “illiberal democracy” or “Christian democracy,” enforcing religious rules and laws that reestablish patriarchy.   

Project 2025 was backed by the right-wing Heritage Foundation, which has ties to Orbán’s Danube Institute, and to the extent he talks about policies, Trump echoes that game plan. He has promised, for example, that he would replace civil servants with loyalists and today again vowed to get rid of the Department of Education, both key items in Project 2025.

Vance has gone further, attacking secular American society itself. In 2021 he said in an interview that American “conservatives…have lost every major powerful institution in the country, except for maybe churches and religious institutions, which of course are weaker now than they’ve ever been. We’ve lost big business. We’ve lost finance. We’ve lost the culture. We’ve lost the academy. And if we’re going to actually really affect real change in the country, it will require us completely replacing the existing ruling class with another ruling class…. I don’t think there’s sort of a compromise that we’re going to come with the people who currently actually control the country. Unless we overthrow them in some way, we’re going to keep losing.” “We really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power,” he said. 

On Saturday, Vance spoke at an event hosted by right-wing extremist evangelical leader Lance Wallnau, a member of the New Apostolic Reformation movement that seeks to end the separation of church and state and put the United States under religious rule. At the event, Vance claimed that “American children… can’t add five plus five, but they can tell you that there are 87 different genders.” He claimed that schools are teaching children “radical ideas” rather than “reading, writing, arithmetic.” He called it “creeping socialism in our schools,” and called for cutting funding for public education. 

The White House today said that more than 3,300 federal personnel are deployed in the states impacted by Hurricane Helene and that at least 50,000 people from 31 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada are working to restore power. FEMA has moved in food and is working to restore cell coverage; federal search and rescue teams are on the ground; the U.S. Coast Guard is working to reopen damaged ports; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is assessing damage and moving debris; the Environmental Protection Agency is working on water systems; the Small Business Administration has 50 people on the ground to support small businesses; the U.S. Department of Energy is monitoring power, fuel, and supply chains; the Department of Agriculture is extending credit to farmers who lost crops and livestock.  

At a campaign event in Las Vegas tonight, Vice President Harris said “we will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild.”

Yesterday, I attended and spoke at a rally with our next Vice President, Senator J.D. Vance, in Newtown, Bucks County. Jim Worthington’s Newtown Athletic Club was full, and thousands of people came to see and hear from our winning team! Click here or below to watch a clip of my remarks.

Pictured below speaking.

President Trump’s second-term agenda will revive the American economy through competitive tax rates, responsible spending initiatives, pro-American energy policies, and deregulation that allows small businesses to thrive. On the other hand, a Harris administration will be marked by more spending, taxes, and regulations. Pennsylvanians cannot afford the Harris agenda. I joined CNN's ""Inside Politics with Dana Bash"" to discuss further. Click here to watch.

Vice President Kamala Harris represents a stark contrast—embracing policies built on weakness and improvisation. Why delay action with empty ""day one"" promises when you can start delivering results today, Madame Vice President? I joined Newsmax's ""Wake Up America"" to discuss. Click here or below to watch.

I also joined Fox Business to further discuss the importance of electing President Trump and his plans to fix the economy. Click here or below to watch.

Additionally, I joined WILK Newsradio to discuss the issues surrounding the economy. Click here or below to listen..

Kamala Harris’ push for grocery price controls and her attack on domestic energy are threats to Pennsylvania’s farmers. Many rely on natural gas, and when energy prices rise due to the Biden-Harris policies, their costs follow. From fertilizer to fuel, it’s becoming unaffordable, putting their livelihoods at risk. Under President Trump, farmers thrived with policies that prioritized them.

This impact goes beyond just agriculture. Fracking, vital to Pennsylvania’s economy, supports nearly 500,000 jobs across the Commonwealth. Yet the Biden-Harris Administration continues to undermine the industry with regulations and taxes. Harris may claim she won't ban fracking, but we already know her policies will cripple the industry.
Trump will support our farmers, safeguard energy jobs, and stand up for America, ensuring we’re not dependent on foreign adversaries. Click here or below to listen.

President Trump was in Indiana County this week for a rally. I joined the ""John Steigerwald Show"" on 1250AM to discuss the economy and other issues. Click here or below to listen.

The U.S. Senate released a scathing report regarding the United States Secret Service's failures at the Butler rally in July. I joined NewsNation to discuss the report and the second assassination attempt against former President Trump, as well as the economy. Click here or below to watch.

President Trump will be returning to Butler on 10/5 for a rally. I was in the front row on July 13 at the rally where a gunman attempted to assassinate the President. I will be there again next week, on October 5th. We must take back our country, and the presidency will be won or lost in Pennsylvania. I am proud to stand with President Trump. If you want to attend the rally, please click here or below to register for tickets.

IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Open borders have tragic consequences — and blood is on Kamala’s hands.

Biden-Harris’ own Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed they have released 650,000 illegal immigrants charged and convicted of crimes into our country. This includes 13,099 convicted murderers and 15,811 convicted of sexual assault. Click here or below to watch a report from Fox News on these sky-high numbers.

Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Secretary Mayorkas should be imprisoned for creating this horrible scenario. Harris and any Democrat who voted for these open border policies should not receive a single vote from an American citizen for the unbelievable level of long-term damage, danger, and crime their agenda has created — an open border agenda that Harris would only continue. Anyone considering voting for Harris for president is voting for these numbers to double and will bear the responsibility for the crime and danger created.

Over just the past two weeks alone:

Grand Rapids, Michigan: A Mexican national — who was deported during the Trump administration, then returned under Kamala — pled guilty to brutally murdering his girlfriend and dumping her body along a highway.

Dormont, Pennsylvania: An illegal alien — who illegally crossed back into the country after being previously deported — was arrested in a fatal hit-and-run that claimed the life of a 23-year-old man.

Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin: An illegal alien and member of the brutal Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang was arrested on multiple charges of sexual abuse, child abuse, and disorderly conduct.

Rome, Georgia: An illegal alien from Mexico — who had previously been deported at least four times over the past decade — was arrested in a head-on drunk driving crash that critically injured a one-year-old child and killed both parents.

St. Louis, Missouri: An illegal alien — who already had a lengthy criminal record — was arrested in a drunk driving crash that killed St. Louis
Metropolitan Police Officer David Lee, an 18-year department veteran who leaves behind a wife and two kids.

Boston, Massachusetts: An illegal alien from Haiti — who was released into the country by the Harris-Biden administration in 2022 — was arrested for sexually assaulting a woman.

San Antonio, Texas: An illegal alien — released into the country by the Harris-Biden administration in 2022 — was arrested in connection to gang-related weapons trafficking.

Rochester, New York: An illegal alien — wanted for murder in the Dominican Republic — was charged in a horrific quadruple murder, including two kids, after he started their house on fire.

Little Rock, Arkansas: An illegal alien from Honduras, who was deported under President Trump, then recently re-entered the country, was arrested in a fatal drunk driving crash that killed a 48-year-old infant respiratory therapist.

Joplin, Missouri: Two Honduran illegal alien brothers robbed a man, shot him in the head, and stole his car to buy drugs across state lines — as the pair was on the run for committing a series of other heinous crimes.

Nantucket, Massachusetts: An illegal alien from El Salvador — previously released on bail in sanctuary city Boston — was arrested for 11 sex crimes, including rape, indecent assault, and battery on a child under 14-years-old.

Things will be so much worse if Kamala is elected in November. She coddles illegals by backing an end to deportations, mass amnesty, sanctuary cities, abolishing ICE, decriminalizing illegal border crossings, free health care for illegals, and so much more.

President Trump, meanwhile, will carry out the largest deportation operation in American history as he seeks to rid the country of the violent criminals, gang members, and terrorists who have flooded in.

Kamala won't be able to escape accountability for the disaster she's created — we won't let her.

I introduced H.R. 9763 the No Funding Without Freedom Act. The bill would prohibit U.S. financial aid to Afghanistan until every wrongfully detained American citizen is released by the Taliban, including Ryan Corbett, who grew up in Susquehanna County.
Last month marked three years since the Biden-Harris Administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, which allowed the Taliban to seize control of the country. And despite the Taliban’s wrongful imprisonment of Americans like Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann, this administration has continued to provide billions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the terror group. The United States is the largest humanitarian donor to Afghanistan, and my legislation would ensure that not one penny more will be sent until every American hostage is released. We must leverage all options, including withholding financial aid, to secure the release of Ryan and George. Click here or below to read more.

At a committee hearing this week, I questioned the entire U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about why the SEC is pushing ahead with sweeping equity market structure reforms without waiting for critical updated trading data. These rushed changes could introduce volatility and harm investors. It was valuable to hear that not all Commissioners agree with the SEC's rapid pace of rulemaking. We need thoughtful reforms that balance market stability with investor confidence, not rushed decisions that could have unintended consequences. That means slowing down and listening to public feedback, which Chair Gensler failed to do during his tenure. Click here or below to watch.

I’m grateful to have received the Champion of Small Business Investing Award from the Small Business Investor Alliance (SBIA). This award recognizes Members of Congress who support policies that promote domestic investment and capital access for small businesses, enabling them to grow, innovate, and create jobs. As a Member of the House Small Business Committee, I will continue working to advance pro-growth initiatives and investment opportunities for entrepreneurs. Thank you to the SBIA for your dedication to strengthening Main Street America.

Americans for Prosperity is a premier advocacy group fighting for lower taxes, limited government, and economic freedom. As a champion of these values in Congress, I was happy to receive AFP’s Pioneer of Prosperity Award. In Congress, I will always advocate for fiscal responsibility and legislative initiatives that create sustainable growth and lasting economic opportunities for all Pennsylvanians.

I met with National Independent Automobile Dealers Association members in my Washington office. We discussed efforts to combat the catalytic converter theft epidemic in Pennsylvania and nationwide, regulatory challenges for independent dealers, the FTC’s new CARS Rule, and other key issues affecting the automobile industry.

It was great to meet with Ancera CEO Arjun Ganesan, whose company specializes in technology for monitoring food supply chains and enhancing operational efficiency. We discussed their innovative solutions to challenges facing the poultry industry and the food supply chain.

I had the opportunity to speak with the George Washington University College Republicans and share my experience as a Member of Congress. We had an in-depth discussion on the current political environment and the issues facing our country, followed by insightful questions from the students. I appreciate the GW College Republicans inviting me to connect with such driven young leaders and engage with the next generation of conservative voices.

One of the most impressive successes of this election season has been the sizeable gains in voter registration made by the Republican Party. Republicans have been gaining in registration in every corner of the Commonwealth. This week, Luzener County shifted to a Republican majority in registered voters! Just a few years ago, in 2020, Democrats had an almost 20,000 Democrat voter advantage, and now, thanks to the hard work of Republican leaders and dedicated volunteers, the tide has turned.

This achievement reflects the commitment and effort so many individuals in Luzerne County put in. This dedication lays the groundwork for continued success, including President Donald Trump's re-election and his return to the White House on November 5th.

I was happy to join the Montgomery County GOP for their Fall Reception with RNC Co-Chairman Michael Whatley. It was a large, energetic crowd ready to turn out the vote in Montco! Thank you to my good friend, Bob Asher, for inviting me. With 36 days to the general election, we all need to be working hard, getting our friends and family registered to vote, and making sure that everyone has a plan for Election Day so that we can send President Donald Trump back to the White House and ensure victory for our Republican candidates.

On Friday, I had a great time at the Bloomsburg fair! I met many people from across the district, and I even bought a Holstein bull during the auction with farmer Brian Campbell, which supports the 4H and feeds hungry families through the Central PA Food Bank! Also at the fair was the Stuart Tank Memorial Association, with one of their tanks produced in Berwick during WW2. While I was at the fair, I also ran into Scott Presler and Early Vote Action, who was registering people to vote at the fair and doing all he could to ensure that Donald Trump is victorious come November 5th.

Planning to vote... do it now and Swamp the Vote! In Pennsylvania, it is time to request your mail-in and absentee ballots. Click here or below to get more information.

Atlanta, GA – Governor Brian P. Kemp today joined the Georgia Department of Economic Development (GDEcD) in announcing that the state broke tourism records for the second year in a row and maintained its No. 5 market share ranking among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., for the fourth consecutive year.

Speaking at the annual Georgia Governor’s Tourism Conference, Governor Kemp shared that the state welcomed 5 million more visitors last year than in 2022, reaching a new high of 171 million domestic and international visitors. These travelers spent $43.6 billion on Georgia’s hotels, restaurants, transportation, and other local businesses, eclipsing the previous record set in 2022 by nearly $4 billion.

“Georgia continues to grow as a top destination for travelers and businesses alike,” said Governor Brian Kemp. “We’ve seen unprecedented visitation across all regions of the Peach State over the last couple years, a testament to the unique attractions, natural resources, and cultural institutions that make Georgia such a desirable place to visit. We're grateful for all our tourism partners statewide who support jobs in communities in all four corners of Georgia.”

In total during 2023, Georgia travel and tourism generated a $79.7 billion statewide economic impact and supported more than 463,400 jobs, an increase of more than 20,000 jobs over the prior year. The tourism industry also generated a record $5 billion in state and local tax revenues, a $300 million or 7.2% increase over the previous record set in 2022.

“Tourism is one of Georgia’s largest economic contributors, supporting jobs and generating tax revenues that benefit local communities from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Golden Isles,” said GDEcD Commissioner Pat Wilson. “These numbers are the latest confirmation that our partnership approach to economic development across all industries – including tourism – is putting Georgia on travelers’ minds like never before. I’m proud of our tourism industry’s commitment to excellence and innovative strategies that drive economic benefits to every corner of the state.”

Presented by Explore Georgia, GDEcD’s tourism office, the three-day Georgia Governor’s Tourism Conference is the premier annual event for the state’s travel and hospitality industry. Drawing 400 attendees from across the state each year, the conference serves to inspire excellence and elevate the state’s tourism efforts to raise national and international awareness of Georgia as a business and leisure destination, with diverse landscapes and experiences that span county lines and industries, from arts and film to sports and agriculture.

“Georgia’s tourism economy has never been stronger!” said GDEcD Chief Marketing Officer Mark Jaronski. “Thanks to the leadership of Governor Kemp, our General Assembly, Commissioner Wilson, Tourism Foundation Board of Directors, statewide tourism team led by Director Jay Markwalter, and the collective efforts of the entire industry, Georgia is seeing record visitation, a double-digit increase in visitor spending, and a total economic impact equivalent to hosting the largest sporting event in history - the 2026 FIFA World Cup - 160 times in one year.”

This year’s conference was held at the Georgia World Congress Center’s (GWCC) new signature hotel, the Signia by Hilton Atlanta, to showcase first-hand one of the state’s premier convention destinations. The ""meetings and conventions segment"" of travel that include events like those held at the GWCC complex generates billions of dollars annually in direct visitor spending and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the state. In 2023, 16.4 million business-related travelers to Georgia drove $4.3 billion in spending, marking an increase of nearly 10 million business-related travelers and more than $1 billion in spending compared to 2022.

Billy Hickman Leads Senate Study Committee on Farmland Preservation Meeting at Habersham EMC

ATLANTA (September 4, 2024) — Last Friday, August 30, the Senate Study Committee on Farmland Preservation convened at Habersham EMC to discuss the future of farmland preservation in Georgia. The meeting focused on the challenges and opportunities facing Georgia’s farmlands, with an emphasis on the state’s agricultural industries, Conservation Use Valuation Assessment (CUVA) programs and the role of local governments in managing development and growth.

The committee received detailed reports on the current state of Georgia’s poultry and industries. Representatives from the Georgia Poultry Federation and the Georgia Farm Bureau provided insights into the economic impact and challenges these sectors face.

A significant portion of the meeting focused on the CUVA program, which is crucial in preserving agricultural and forest lands in Georgia. The committee heard an overview of CUVA from the Department of Revenue, followed by a discussion on proposed reforms to the program, particularly regarding leased property.

The committee also explored the role of local governments in shaping development and growth, with input from key stakeholders representing county and municipal interests. The meeting concluded with a public comment session, during which attendees shared their perspectives on farmland preservation.

Chairman of the Senate Study Committee on Farmland Preservation, Sen. Billy Hickman (R–Statesboro), expressed his appreciation for the participation and insights shared at the meeting, stating, “These discussions are crucial as we work to protect Georgia’s farmland for future generations. Input from our industry leaders, local officials and the public is invaluable in shaping policies that support our agricultural communities while fostering sustainable growth. I look forward to continuing these important conversations at our next meeting.”

The Senate Study Committee on Farmland Preservation’s next meeting will be held at the Georgia Sunbelt Agriculture Expo on Wednesday, September 25, 2024.

The week began with a field trip to Narragansett Bay Commission's (NBC) Field’s Point Wastewater Treatment. Environmental Engineer Jack Segal with DEM’s Office of Water Resources, and NBC’s Talia Cheshier, led students on a tour around the state’s largest wastewater treatment facility. Students also visited NBC’s lab and met some of the biologists and chemists who test water quality and monitor the health of Narragansett Bay. Through job shadowing, students gained insight into the many different DEM careers. Students in the Fish and Wildlife track joined DEM Pollinator Entomologist Toby Shaya on a bee survey at Great Swamp Management Area where they found four different bumblebee species. Marine Fisheries students assisted in a fish trawl survey, collecting different fish species including smooth dogfish, skates, and longfin squid. The Forestry and Agriculture track joined DEM Senior Environmental Scientist Matt Green on annual inspections at plant nurseries around southern Rhode Island to inspect for plant pests and for certification of nursery stock. Students in the Water Resources track traveled to Winnapaug Salt Pond to survey potential bacterial pollution sources, collect water samples, and then used microscopes to monitor for HAB (Harmful Algae Bloom) phytoplankton in this shellfish growing area. Environmental Protection students spent time job shadowing with DEM’s Office of Air Resources (OAR) last week and had the opportunity to visit Rhode Island LFG Genco for a tour of the facility generating electricity from landfill waste gas. Environmental Protection students also joined OAR at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate RI becoming the first state to complete Phase 1 of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The week concluded with a focus on climate change and sustainability. Guest speakers included Dave McLaughlin for DEM Environmental Sustainability Policy, Elizabeth Stone and Rachel Calabro from the Climate Policy Team, DEM's Climate Justice Specialist Chris Gaynor, and Georgia Young the DEM Director’s Office URI Energy Fellow. DEM's RIsing Environmental Leaders program is an initiative of the Department's Equal Opportunity Advisory Committee (EOAC) in partnership with Skills for Rhode Island's Future. Throughout the six-week program, 12 high school students from across Rhode Island will get the opportunity to explore careers at DEM through job shadowing, guest speakers, and field trips.", ,no longer populated,,2024-07-23T19:34:59.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQzFMTnlRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--41ea8a89ec384ab012c3c08e78fc12a01a7383b7/post-18590008-277446775-thumbnail,8,2,0,0,,

Fresh Start Produce Sales’ FDA-posted recall notice says the whole cucumbers — no mini cucumbers or English cucumbers — were 1.5 to 2 inches around and 5 to 9 inches long. From May 17 through May 21, the cucumbers went to distributors in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.  Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture, Fresh Start’s notice says, found salmonella in a cucumber. The FDA is looking into whether this is “related to an ongoing salmonella outbreak investigation.”  As first pointed out by food safety attorney Bill Marler, the only salmonella outbreak on the FDA’s active investigation chart concerns a salmonella africana outbreak with 141 people sickened and a food link not yet identified.  Salmonella, according to the CDC, sickens about 1.35 million people in the United States each year. Usually, the diarrhea, stomachaches and fever last four to seven days. In about 26,500 people, the diarrhea is bad enough for hospitalization. About 420 people are killed each year by the foodborne disease. Full article @ www.miamiherald.com . . .

What a coincidence. The USDA has been identified as being practically at the historical core of the Malthusian conspiracy that is driving most if not all of the present insanity. Anyone who knows anything about the (Malthusian) eugenics movement in America knows that, at its epicenter was Charles Davenport's Eugenics Record Office which was located at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island. Although historians will gladly tell you that the ERO was funded into existence by the Harriman family, what you're not told is that the nucleus of the ERO was created earlier as part of the American Breeders Association which was itself practically a product of the USDA.

HENRY COUNTY, GA. – April 24, 2024 – At its regularly held Tuesday meeting, the Henry County Board of Commissioners passed an ordinance increasing the excise tax on “hotel, motel, inn, lodge, tourist camp, tourist cabin, campground, or any other place in which rooms or lodgings are regularly furnished for value” from five to eight percent. 

In 2010, the Georgia General Assembly passed House Bill 1470, which authorized Henry County to grow the excise tax to eight percent. Half of the additional tax revenue shall be expended for promoting tourism, conventions, and trade shows. The remaining half is to be used for interchange beautification, wayfinding signage and road enhancement, investments in select parks and recreation resources, public assembly facilities, and other tourism projects. 

Items on the agenda included:
•	A resolution approving a Memorandum of Understanding with the Board of Regents. This relates to the cooperative extension program. A 100-year partnership. Extension faculty and staff conduct educational programs for youth and adults in the community. Specifically, these focus on agriculture, natural resources, environmental management, family and consumer sciences 4-H/youth development, and related subjects.

•	A resolution to amend the Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget to make final appropriations available. This is a standard procedure carried out by the Department of Finance in accordance with OCGA 36-81-3. 

•	A resolution to approve and adopt the Henry County employee benefit and medical insurance plans for 2024-25. Providers contracted include UnitedHealthcare, Kaiser Permanente, Delta Dental, EyeMed, Cigna, Standard Life Insurance, New York Life, and Lane Health. 

•	A resolution approving an Intergovernmental Agreement between Henry County and the Henry County Development Authority, which conveys 28.7 acres located at the Atlanta Speedway Airport in Hampton in order to market the property for data center, advanced manufacturing/aerospace, and/or advanced manufacturing/automotive usage.

When does the Farmers Market open this year? We can’t wait! A. The Union County Farmers Market is scheduled to open June 1 this year. The hours will be 8am to 1pm on Saturdays and 9am to 1pm on Tuesdays. We are looking forward to another busy season this year with many return vendors and some new additions. For more information, you can visit their website at www.ucfarmersmarket.com or you can call them at 706-439-6043. Q. Can I bring my dog to the Farmers Market? A. If you would like to bring your dog, the Humane Society’s Mountain Shelter has volunteers there offering pet sitting for a donation to the shelter, however there are no pets allowed under the covered area of the Farmers Market, with the exception of legitimate service dogs. This is because of safety regulations pertaining to the sale of food. It is the same reason you cannot take your dog into the grocery store. Q. I grow tomatoes and peppers in my back yard. Can I rent a booth at the Farmers Market this year? A. Many of the current vendors return year after year. This means that very few booths come available each season. Locals looking to schedule a booth for a season can download a copy of the application from the Union County Government website or can call or drop by the Farmers Market. A few spaces are left available each season for walk-up vendors. Walk-up vendors can obtain a space on a first-come first served basis. Preference is given to agricultural products. Q. What can be sold at the Union County Farmers Market? A. All vendors must meet and abide by license requirements from the Georgia Department of Agriculture, the Union County Health Department as well as those required by the USDA. Vendors can sell food in its raw or natural state including fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs, honey, USDA-approved meat, candied eggs. Bedding plants and potted plants grown from seed, plugs, cuttings, bulbs, and bare root. Woody plants and bedding plants may be re-potted and sold if they have been in the seller’s possession for 45 days (no resale of pre-finished plants is allowed). Fresh cut flowers and cultivated mushrooms are permitted if grown by the vendor on their property. No foraged items are permitted. B. Value-Added Agricultural Products are those grown by a vendor and modified/enhanced by the same vendor such as cheese, cider, dog treats, fiber products, etc. Vendors selling these types of products must have any applicable licenses from the Georgia Department of Agriculture (ie Dairy or Feed Licenses) and meet all federal, state and local regulations. C. Pre-packaged foods prepared by any process other than washing such as breads, rolls, biscuits, cakes, pastries, jams, granola, etc., can be sold. These must be prepared from scratch meaning there shall be nothing sold using commercially prepared mixes, crusts/shells, or fillings. Vendors selling these products must package, label, and have a Cottage Food License in accordance with the Georgia Department of Agriculture and meet all federal, state and local regulations. A full list of product qualifications is available online at: ucfarmersmarket.com Q. Can non-food items be sold at the Union County Farmers Market? A. All crafts are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. They shall be a product of a home or cottage type industry and include handmade soap (not produced by a farmer), woodworking, pottery, quilted/knitted/crocheted products, jewelry, cutlery, candles etc. Members selling these items must have created them. The items must be handcrafted, original, and exhibit a high level of quality and design. Q. When is the Trash to Treasures open at the Farmers Market? A.

The task force draws members from the White House and the departments of Transportation, Commerce, Agriculture, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Energy, and Homeland Security. It is focused on coordinating efforts to divert ships to other ports and to minimize impacts to employers and workers, making sure, for example, that dock workers stay on payrolls. Today, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg convened a meeting of port, labor, and industry partners—ocean carriers, truckers, local business owners, unions, railroads, and so on—to mitigate disruption from the bridge collapse. Representatives came from 40 organizations including American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier; the Georgia Ports Authority; the International Longshoremen’s Association, the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots; John Deere; Maersk; Mercedes-Benz North America Operations; Seabulk Tankers; Under Armour; and the World Shipping Council. Today the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration announced it would make $60 million available immediately to be used as a down payment toward initial costs. Already, though, some Republicans are balking at the idea of using new federal money to rebuild the bridge, saying that lawmakers should simply take the money that has been appropriated for things like electric vehicles, or wait until insurance money comes in from the shipping companies. In 2007, when a bridge across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis suddenly collapsed, Congress passed funding to rebuild it in days and then-president George W. Bush signed the measure into law within a week of the accident. In the past days, we have learned that the six maintenance workers killed when the bridge collapsed were all immigrants, natives of Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Around 39% of the workforce in the construction industry around Baltimore and Washington, D.C., about 130,000 people, are immigrants, Scott Dance and María Luisa Paúl reported in the Washington Post yesterday. Some of the men were undocumented, and all of them were family men who sent money back to their home countries, as well. From Honduras, the nephew of one of the men killed told the Associated Press, “The kind of work he did is what people born in the U.S. won’t do. People like him travel there with a dream. They don’t want to break anything or take anything.” In the Philadelphia Inquirer today, journalist Will Bunch castigated the right-wing lawmakers and pundits who have whipped up native-born Americans over immigration, calling immigrants sex traffickers and fentanyl dealers, and even “animals.” Bunch illustrated that the reality of what was happening on the Francis Scott Key Bridge when it collapsed creates an opportunity to reframe the immigration debate in the United States. Last month, Catherine Rampell of the Washington Post noted that immigration is a key reason that the United States experienced greater economic growth than any other nation in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The surge of immigration that began in 2022 brought to the U.S. working-age people who, Director Phill Swagel of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote, are expected to make the U.S. gross domestic product about $7 trillion larger over the ten years from 2023 to 2034 than it would have been otherwise. Those workers will account for about $1 trillion dollars in revenues. Curiously, while Republican leaders today are working to outdo each other in their harsh opposition to immigration, it was actually the leaders of the original Republican Party who recognized the power of immigrants to build the country and articulated an economic justification for increased immigration during the nation’s first major anti-immigrant period. The United States had always been a nation of immigrants, but in the 1840s the failure of the potato crop in Ireland sent at least half a million Irish immigrants to the United States. As they moved into urban ports on the East Coast, especially in Massachusetts and New York, native-born Americans turned against them as competitors for jobs. The 1850s saw a similar anti-immigrant fury in the new state of California. After the discovery of gold there in 1848, native-born Americans—the so-called Forty Niners—moved to the West Coast. They had no intention of sharing the riches they expected to find. The Indigenous people who lived there had no right to the land under which gold lay, native-born men thought; nor did the Mexicans whose government had sold the land to the U.S. in 1848; nor did the Chileans, who came with mining skills that made them (truncated)", ,no longer populated,,2024-03-29T05:30:39.000Z,post data removed,,46143,13137,2161,0,,

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) gave $1 million to fund risky research on bird flu viruses to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China; the USDA Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athena, Georgia and the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute in Scotland. The plan is to infect ducks and geese with various strains of bird flu to render the virus more infectious and transmissible as scientists study the virus’s ability, “to jump into mammalian hosts.” Documents outlining the research, which began in 2021 and will continue until 2026, were obtained by the White Coat Waste Project.

I am proud of Tyler’s efforts to crack down on bad actors and leveraging law enforcement resources.  He and I believe there is a continued growing threat to our number one industry from China and illegal Chinese nationals coming to Georgia.

In late January, Mandi Remington had $7 in her bank account and had run out of milk. At times like these, which happen toward the end of most months, she cobbles together “stone soup” from what’s in the house, she said or feeds her three children and then makes her own meal from whatever is left on their plates. 

So when she found out that Iowa, where she lives in Iowa City, is among the 15 states that decided not to participate in Summer EBT, a new federal food program that would have sent her $40 a month per child while they were out of school, “it was extremely frustrating,” she said. As a single parent who doesn’t receive child support, Remington struggles to make ends meet. Her $55,000 annual salary as a medical records clerk at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics “does not leave much leftover for gas in the car and groceries,” she said, yet she earns too much to qualify for Medicaid and food stamps.

But she did qualify for Pandemic EBT for the past two years—a federal benefit that sent parents of students who qualify for free or reduced meals up to $120 per child while kids were out of school for remote learning or summer break.

Iowa’s decision not to participate in Summer EBT, the first new federal food program in decades, will mean “a lot more struggling to feed my kids proper healthy foods,” she said. Iowa wasn’t the only state to refuse the funds: Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming opted not to enroll by the early January deadline.

All of those states have one thing in common: They are helmed by Republican governors.

Congress built on the Pandemic EBT model, which was passed as part of its Covid relief bills, to create the permanent Summer EBT program at the end of 2022. The US Department of Agriculture had originally estimated that 29 million children would benefit, but that number has dropped to 21 million after 15 states declined to participate, meaning 8 million kids will miss out.

1. HB 1027 Fire Department Work Schedule

Representative Matthew Hostettler

90-1-yes

• Provides flexibility for firefighter work shifts by allowing fire departments to deviate from set work hour shifts.

• Deviation from work hour shifts is to respect and obtain approval from firefighters based on a collective bargaining agreement, memorandum of understanding, or other similar written mutual agreement.

https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1027/details

2. HB 1073 Special Education

Representative Becky Cash

73-24-yes

• Requires the Commission on Seclusion and Restraint to work on limiting the usage of time out in its model plan.

• Also requires that the commission meet at least twice a year instead of yearly as it is done now.

• Requires schools have security cameras that can capture both audio and visual recordings in rooms that are used for mostly special education students as well as seclusion and time-out areas.

• Schools must keep the data stored for at least 60 days.

https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1073/details

3. HB 1079 Craft Hemp Flower

Representative Jake Teshka

85-11-yes

• Since the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, (2018 Farm Bill), which authorized the production of hemp product and subsequently removed hemp and hemp seeds from the Drug Enforcement Agencey's scheduled controlled substances, hemp manufacturers and distribution businesses in Indiana have struggled to properly ascertain Indiana statutes regarding the production, transportation and distribution of hemp products. 

• HB 1079 allows licensed hemp product handlers (i.e. manufacturer, distributor) to possess, manufacture, distribute, store, transport, or merchandise ‘work in progress’ hemp product (work in progress referring to hemp product exceeding the legal threshold of .03% THC concentration as set forth and previously established by the Indiana Legislature). 

• HB 1079 clearly provides and sets forth a definition for ‘craft hemp flower’ to be utilized when discussing all topics germane to discussion surrounding HB 1079. 

• HB 1079 prohibits the merchandising and or sales of low THC products to such persons underneath those of 21 years of age, including but not limited to; tobacco, e-cigarettes and or e-liquids containing low THC product. 

• HB 1079 alters and re-defines ‘craft hemp flower’ to permanently remove the following syntax from its current definition set forth upon passage of this bill: (1) “controlled-substance analog""; (2) “hashish""; (3) “low THC hemp extract""; or (4) “marijuana”;. This legislation also repeals previously established definitions (1)""hemp bud""; (2) “hemp flower”; and (3)""smokable hemp"" due to its connotation of current criminal statutes. 

https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1079/details

4. HB 1135 Cosmetology Licensure and Apprenticeships

Representative Timothy Wesco

74-22-yes

• Establishes a cosmetology apprenticeship program to support trades and reduce regulatory barriers to enter the practice.

• The apprenticeship program will create another, cheaper avenue to become a licensed cosmetologist.

• Provides clear guidelines for how the apprenticeship program must be managed and monitored, including direct reports and monitoring by the Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners

• Allows cosmetology licensure to transcend state borders ensuring multi-state practice with a singular license.

• Reciprocity is limited to other states with similar legislation such as Kentucky, Alabama, and Arkansas, but other states have legislation pending such as California, Nevada, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Virgina, Georgia, and Maryland.

• This bolsters the cosmetology talent pipeline by creating incentives and ease of travel for licensed cosmetologists to relocate to Indiana.

• Licensure compacts such as this support military families with stable occupations after relocation.

https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1135/details

5. HB 1214 Dental Matters

Representative Denny Zent-I co-authored this bill

92-1-yes

• Creates the Dental and Dental Hygienist Compact (DDH Compact) with the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency (PLA) to support the mobility of licensed dentists and dental hygienists to work within participating states and reduce the barriers to licensure access. 

• Allows for members active in the military and their spouses to pay reduced and/or no fees to practice dentistry in participating states, promoting reciprocity and access to the profession for people from all different backgrounds and locations. 

• Removes obsolete and duplicative language, some of which has existed unchanged since 1913, to modernize code to include gender neutral terms and incorporate inclusivity. 

https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1214/details

6. HB 1243 Various Education and Workforce Related Matters

Representative Robert Behning

96-0

• Gives the Indiana Department of Education (DOE) the flexibility to re create the high school diplomas.

• While Indiana continues to re-imagine high school it is important to have a diploma that accurately reflects the changes, and works with work based learning.

• Allows flexibility for DOE to work with schools to give through the year assessments instead of the single summative assessment that is given at the end of the year currently.

• This ensures that students that are struggling in courses can be identified earlier in the year, to get them the help that they need.

• Ensures that students get practical education when in school by requiring a computer science course in order for graduation.

• Currently in Indiana 91% of public high schools offer a computer science courses, but only 7% of students take them.

• Increases transparency by requiring schools to report all student fees charged to families, and DOE must post that data online.

• Removes barriers for non-public school students, homeschooled and students in the judicial system by allowing a parent, juvenile judge, or non-public head of school to sign off on students taking the High School Equivalency exam.

• Increases transparency in school by requiring schools to report, and post online if they do not meet the 62% of student support funding for teacher compensation target.

• Allows schools that have under 100 students the ability to count up to one student as a waiver for special education for their graduation rate.

• Current law allows only 1% of the cohort, this is changed to 1% or 1 student.

• Requires students to attend eight semesters of high school before they are eligible for a postsecondary waiver.

• Cleans up state law and removes the State Advisory Committee for Students with Disabilities, as the committee is no longer needed.

• Gives the Department of Workforce Development the ability to collect real time data on workforce, to help them give better recommendations in the future for people looking for work.

https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1243/details

7. HB 1352 Inspection of Residential Onsite Sewage Systems

Representative Bob Morris

81-13-yes

• Clears up language in putting septic systems into commercial properties, however commercial properties fall into different category in code than residential properties, so it puts it into a separate section of code.

• If the manufacturer calls for an inspection, then an inspection shall happen on that specific system. Doesn't require automatic 3-year inspections that happen under the Board of Health, only when manufacturer calls for it, whether that be more or less frequently than that previous 3-year inspection, and the cost is not put on the owner of the property.

• Many Hoosiers don't want to install bathrooms or pools into their garages or adjacent properties on their land because of the high cost of too-frequent septic system inspections. This clears up the language and reduces cost for Hoosiers.

• Provides that a county onsite waste management district may not assess a periodic inspection fee against an owner of an onsite sewage disposal system for a particular period if the district does not inspect the owner's system during that period.

I hope everyone had a lovely holiday and 2024 is off to a positive start. 

First, I want to comment on the Special Session from November 29th through December 7th. The General Assembly was ordered by the court to draw new maps for the House, Senate, and Congress. We spent the seven days of the Special Session drawing and debating the new district lines. The majority of changes took place in districts around Metro Atlanta, and, unfortunately, the new district lines paired up some of the colleagues in the House. Once the maps passed the House and Senate, they were returned to the Judge who gave the order. After looking at the new maps, the Judge agreed with the news district lines.

We convened the Georgia General Assembly on Monday, January 8, 2024 at the Capitol in Atlanta. We always start the Second Monday of January, and this year, with New Year's Day being Monday, January 1, we started the 8th. 

The first week of the 2024 Session included a couple of caucus meetings and a Rural Caucus lunch. These Rural Caucus meetings occur each week on Wednesday at noon in the Department of Agriculture Building. We have a speaker at each meeting with individuals from the University of Georgia, Farm Bureau, or other organizations throughout our state, and they explain their connection with our citizens.

The Eggs & Issues Breakfast, which the Georgia Chamber of Commerce hosts, was held at the Mercedes Benz Stadium with 2,500 and 3,000 attendees. Governor Brian Kemp, Lt. Governor Burt Jones, and the Speaker of the House Jon Burns gave comments. Chris Clark, President & CEO of the Georgia Chamber, gave interesting statistics about future workforce needs and challenges that Georgia will face. 

Some of our Independent Colleges came to the Capitol the first week also. I was happy to see students and faculty from LaGrange College, and I took the students on the Floor of the House and then took a quick tour around the Capitol before the Session started that day. 

Governor Kemp gave his State of the State address on Thursday and outlined items that he would like to see the Legislature tackle this Session. 

After observing Martin Luther King Day, we will be in budget meetings for the rest of the week. I am fortunate to serve as Vice Chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of Appropriations, and we will hear from GDOT Commissioner Russell McMurry late Tuesday, January 16th. In my opinion, the budget is one of the most critical items we take up because it deals with our hard-earned tax dollars. 

I appreciate your emails, calls, and letters. Let me know if you are coming to the Capitol so we can talk while you are there.

By Noreen Marcus, FloridaBulldog.org As Florida’s governor tries to demonize and evict immigrants – once even shipping them to an island off Massachusetts – farmworker advocates are fighting back in Miami federal court. They’re attacking a new state law that makes it a felony to bring undocumented immigrants into Florida. The law doesn’t distinguish between transporting people for illegal purposes and for legitimate ones such as farm work. The advocates say Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to label as “human trafficking” migrant laborers’ regular treks between the fields of Florida and neighboring states as they follow seasonal crops from farm to farm. This long-established system underpins the state’s $8-billion agricultural industry that largely exists with migrant labor from Mexico and Central and South America. “Farming in the United States is dependent on an immigrant workforce, largely undocumented, which is less protected and vulnerable to more abuse,” said Yesica Ramirez, general coordinator of the Farmworker Association of Florida (FWAF) in Apopka, speaking through an interpreter. “The undocumented community is the backbone of farming in the U.S.,” said Ramirez. She works with ornamental plants in Central Florida, the hub along with Homestead, of Florida’s horticultural/ nursery business that employs an estimated 100,000 people. Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center, representing the nonprofit FWAF, filed a lawsuit challenging the new law, known as SB 1718 (the Senate bill number), on July 17; it had gone into effect July 1. The suit asks Miami U.S. District Judge Roy Altman to declare the law unconstitutional because only the federal government has the power to regulate immigration. The original defendants were DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody, Statewide Prosecutor Nicholas Cox and the state attorneys for all 20 judicial circuits. DESANTIS JABS ‘BORDER CRISIS’ The FWAF complaint suggests that Florida’s Republican Legislature passed SB 1718 to broadcast an anti-immigrant message from DeSantis, who is running for his party’s presidential nomination. “Florida is a law-and-order state, and we won’t turn a blind eye to the dangers of [President Joe] Biden’s border crisis,” the complaint quotes DeSantis saying when he announced his 2023 legislative agenda. “We will continue to take steps to protect Floridians from reckless federal open border policies,” he said. “SB 1718 is a lot of flash and no substance that, for DeSantis’s campaign purposes, makes him look tough on immigration,” counters Gregory Schell, a lawyer with Southern Migrant Legal Services. He’s not involved in the Miami case. Similar laws in Georgia and Alabama had minimal impact on their undocumented worker base, Schell said. “The law won’t be enforced here, it’s a joke,” he said. In Georgia and Alabama “it scared the bejesus out of people and some voluntarily relocated.” The Florida farmworkers’ complaint says the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees Florida, decided it’s likely that federal law preempts the Georgia and Alabama statutes. The FWAF makes the same argument in the Miami case. On Dec. 18, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill to deter immigration at the Texas-Mexico border. Another lawsuit may be coming soon. Last week in Miami, Judge Altman took the first significant step in the farmworkers’ case by dropping DeSantis – at his request – from the lawsuit, finding “the Governor is an improper party” because he doesn’t personally enforce SB 1718 against the plaintiffs. They are, in addition to FWAF, two farmworkers and seven other people who could suffer the law’s consequences; all are identified by their initials for security reasons. TEMP VISAS FOR FARMWORKERS Opponents of the new state law say it makes an already bad situation worse by sowing confusion and fear about the federal program that allows migrant farm laborers to work in the U.S. legally. Florida is the nation’s biggest user of the U.S. Department of Labor’s H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program. In fiscal year 2023, the state had 51,987 certified positions, or almost 14 percent of the total 378,513, according to the Office of Foreign Labor Certification. California came in second with 40,758 positions. The H-2A visa program was designed to support an industry that needs outsiders because not enough U.S. citizens want farm jobs and the supply of domestic farmworkers is dwindling. Employers obtain the visas, allowing farm laborers to stay in the U.S. for a 10-month season. Then they’re supposed to return home for two months. “It’s an employer’s dream in many ways,” said Schell, the migrant aid lawyer. Though most farm owners presumably follow the rules, if bosses want to exploit workers, the H-2A program doesn’t do much to stop them. A worker can’t change jobs but must stick with the employer who got (truncated)", ,no longer populated,,2024-01-07T18:57:44.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTDFlRlJjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--011c2e1cdbe1e262e8941f3f48d85768a24d4e20/post-11370151-185492673-thumbnail,0,0,0,0,,

Ossoff and Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock are urging the White House to support Georgia’s agricultural industries after this year’s natural disasters — including Hurricane Idalia and a devastating March freeze. “This year, Georgia growers have suffered from natural disasters that have devastated crops and communities across our state. Hurricane Idalia spent more time over Georgia than over any other state, flooding vegetable fields and uprooting pecan trees. A freeze in early March destroyed an estimated 90 percent of Georgia’s peach crop,” Sens. Ossoff and Warnock wrote. “In response to these and other disaster events, we respectfully request that you include funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the Administration’s forthcoming supplemental appropriations requests.”", ,no longer populated,,2023-10-24T20:14:42.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSGltSmhNPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7ad29af9c781209bc2bb0bab3414fc2162c9cd2a/post-6914311-163147153-thumbnail,34,8,2,0,,

Communitarianism is a philosophy that emphasizes the connection between the individual and the community.Its overriding philosophy is based upon the belief that a person's social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships, with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism.

WEF Says Fashion Will Be Abolished by 2030: “Humans Will All Wear a Uniform” The World Economic Forum has declared that by 2030 fashion will become completely obsolete and all humans will be vegan, whether they like it or not.
A newly resurfaced report written in 2019 states that humans will only be permitted to buy three items of clothing per year and will be prohibited from buying or consuming meat. Published in 2019,
‘The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World’ report funded by the WEF,sets out extreme targets for governments around the globe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as consistent with the 2015 Paris Agreement ambitions.

Recent scientific studies confirm that the earths basic resources are vastly greater than what are needed to feed even the 10 billion people who are to inhabit the planet by the middle of the next century.The real threat is not that the earth will run out of land topsoil or water but that nations will fail to pursue the economic trade and research policies that can increase the production of food and limit environmental damage.
The conventional solutions to the world food problem heavily publicized by groups such as Zero Population Growth the Pew Global Stewardship Initiative and a coalition called the U.S.
Network for Cairo 1994 focus almost exclusively on population control.But even the most draconian birth control efforts cannot prevent earths population from almost doubling.Agricultural production is still on a rapid upward trend and the world price of food has been declining for the past 50 years.Since 1970 it has dropped by one half in real terms.Malnutrition afflicts 700 million people because poor nations do not have enough money to buy food.Nor is the poverty of the Third World simply a reflection of the rapaciousness of the First World.
The United States uses far less energy and produces far less carbon dioxide per dollar of GDP added to the worlds economy and has far more stringent environmental policies than many developing nations.In India the government provided farmers with free electricity which encouraged them to overpump water leading to salinization and waterlogging of soils.
While poverty and a lack of intensive production methods have forced millions ofThird World farmers to overgraze marginal range land modern intensive methods of cultivation in developed countries such as no-till farming have dramatically reduced the amount of land water soil and energy required to produce a ton of grain while boosting yields significantly.

White Hats Military Arrest Deep Stater Janet Yellen For Treason🧙🚨🧑‍🚀🐝https://realrawnews.com/2023/09/janet-yellen-arrested-for-treason/
Investigators from the U.S. Army’s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) on Tuesday arrested Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen at a Maryland hotel, alleging that the Deep State despot had engineered a diabolical scheme that clandestinely sent hundreds of billions of American tax dollars to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, far more than the $75bn the criminal Biden Regime has admitted to giving its felonious collaborator in Ukraine.
A source at CID’s Fort Liberty, NC, field office told Real Raw News that investigators apprehended Yellen and an unnamed associate outside the Merriweather Lakehouse Hotel in Baltimore at approximately 9:30 p.m. Yellen was shown a military arrest warrant charging her with treason and defrauding the United States of America before being shuttled to a processing center for interrogation.
He said Yellen seemed bewildered at the news and did not try to flee or resist. The associate, identified as Yellen’s chauffeur and bodyguard, was jailed as an accessory to Yellen’s crimes.
The White Hats’ investigation into Yellen’s criminality began in October 2022, when Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Shannon Corless voluntarily surrendered to JAG personnel in Pensacola, Fl, claiming she had helped Yellen conceal financial transactions whereby they unlawfully redistributed tens of millions of Treasury Department dollars to radical left organizations such as ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter. At the time, Corless offered JAG an SD card allegedly holding proof of her claims and potentially more incriminating evidence against Yellen. She said she was unable to access several password-protected files.
The data in those files, JAG would later discover, implicated Yellen in financial crimes that exponentially surpassed the millions of dollars threshold. According to our source, Yellen used handsomely paid minions to funnel Zelenskyy cash while obfuscating her own lawbreaking.
“There are smoking guns there,” our source said. “We can now prove the administration gave Ukraine $50bn four months before Vladimir Putin launched his Special Military Operation in Ukraine, for example. There is no public mention of these disbursements. Each transaction has the same common denominator—Yellen and Treasury. It has taken a long time to catch this one. There’s a few reasons this country has gone bankrupt, and she’s one of them.”
He said Yellen was among the horde of Deep Staters to flee the United States once the regime’s despots suspected their names appeared on sealed indictments, and learned that their avaricious allies were being charged with, convicted of, and executed for high treason.
Fearing arrest, Yellen left the U.S. for Eastern Europe in early November, and the timing somewhat coincided with Corless handing JAG the SD card. Our source said Yellen had made several brief trips back to the U.S. between then and May, but White Hats hadn’t received word until after the fact.
“September 5, we learned that Biden recalled her to the States. I can’t detail how we found out or how we pinpointed her or why she was at a hotel instead of her house—but there are reasons for all of that. We had her under surveillance in Maryland for a week. She’ll be interrogated, and JAG will decide where she goes. Wherever that is, it’s good riddance,” our source said.
August 30/ 2023Michael BaxterAuthor
Urgent: As RRN reported in March 2022, White Hat’s seized FEMA’s Mt. Weather stronghold and control of the Emergency Broadcast System. Mainstream media outlets reported yesterday, however, that FEMA will issue a nationwide test next month. FEMA has built a new EAS. I have known of this for the last two months but was asked not to report on it as White Hats have been attempting to locate the location of their new transmitter. Now that FEMA announced the test, I have been given permissoin to author a piece on it, which I will publish in the next two days. What’s important is this: White Hats have encouraged their own to DISABLE their phones between 2:00 and 3:00 pm EST October 4, as the phones could ping back to FEMA. I know I will be disabling mine, too. What you do is up to you that day.

If you need assistance or would like to report damage to your home or within your community, please first contact your local Emergency Management Agency. You can find contact information for your local Emergency Management Agency here (https://gema.georgia.gov/locations) or, if you live in one of the following counties in South Georgia, call the number listed below: Lowndes County: 229-671-2790 Brooks County: 229-263-4262 Cook County: 229-896-1196 Glynn County: 912-554-7735 Ware County: 912-287-4394 Clinch County: 912-599-9404 Echols County: 229-559-6538 If you cannot reach your local Emergency Management Agency, please call 211 to report an issue, or contact the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency at 404-635-7200 or 1-800-879-4362. If your request for assistance specifically relates to damage to your home or property, you can also call the Crisis Cleanup Hotline, which is supported by FEMA, at 800-451-1954. Through this hotline, FEMA will work to connect you with volunteers from local relief organizations, community groups, and faith-based groups who may be able to assist you by cutting fallen trees; removing drywall, flooring, and appliances; tarping roofs; and mitigating the spread of mold. This service is free, and the hotline will remain open through September 15. Please note that the service is not guaranteed due to overwhelming need at this time, and the service cannot assist with social services like food, clothing, shelter, or insurance. Those with requests for assistance with farm and agricultural damage can also contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) at 706-546-2266. It is very important that agricultural producers keep detailed records of damages and report such damages to their local USDA Service Center as soon as possible. You can find your local service center here (https://www.farmers.gov/working-with-us/service-center-locator). Per USDA guidance, producers should refrain from clearing damages until an environmental assessment has been conducted by your local county office. Failure to follow these instructions could harm the producer’s eligibility for federal aid. If you need additional assistance, you can contact the American Red Cross Regional Office in Atlanta at 404-876-3302. A full list of contact information for Red Cross offices in Georgia can be found here (https://www.redcross.org/local/georgia.html). Senator Ossoff is closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Georgia and has been in constant contact with local, state, and federal officials, as well as affected constituents, to ensure Georgians can access the resources they need during this difficult time. Earlier today, Sens. Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock sent a letter to President Biden urging him to issue Federal disaster assistance should the Governor of Georgia request it. A request for Federal disaster assistance must come from the State’s Governor. Senator Ossoff and his staff remain available to answer questions and direct you to local resources which may be of further assistance. Anyone seeking assistance from Senator Ossoff’s office can email caseworkteam@ossoff.senate.gov.", ,no longer populated,,2023-08-31T21:29:31.000Z,post data removed,,29,18,0,0,,

Plus, you&#39;re gonna hear from Harlan Proveaux, the Inspector General, and Director of the
Law Enforcement &amp; Emergency Management Division at the Georgia Department of Agriculture. The vital role his division plays in protecting
Georgia&#39;s Ag industry. These stories and so much more - right now
on the Farm Monitor. [RAY]
So recently, peanut growers from Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi gathered
at the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort for the annual Southern Peanut Growers Conference. Needless to say, it was quite the gathering. Damon Jones was there and reports on the challenges
growers face at both the state and national levels as they gear up for the upcoming harvest
season. [Destin, Florida/ Damon Jones – Reporting]
While Sandestin might be a spot for those looking for a little fun in the sun, it recently
played host to a conference highlighting one of Georgia&#39;s staple crops, the peanut. Here at the Southern Peanut Growers Conference,
producers got an opportunity to hear from experts, share ideas with fellow growers and
get a fresh perspective about the industry. [Joe Boddiford – Chairman, GA Peanut Commission]
We&#39;re bringing in a wider array of speakers. We&#39;re trying to reach out into other areas
that sometimes we&#39;re not thinking about. We have our county production meetings. We have a state production meeting in Georgia
every year. And that gets you the basic knowledge on the
production and all of that. But sometimes we need to think outside the
box. And this is an opportunity to do it. [Damon]
That&#39;s exactly what longtime Congressman Austin Scott encouraged the growers to do, as he
discussed an overlooked aspect when it comes to negotiating the new Farm Bill in Washington. [Rep. Austin Scott – (R) Georgia, 8th District]
Who owns the data on, on the crops that come off your farm? Uh, some of the tractor companies want to
own it. The seed companies want to own it. Uh, ultimately, I believe it should belong
to the farmer. Now, if the farmer decides that they want
to contract that data out, that&#39;s an asset of the farmer and they&#39;ve got the right to
do that. But, you know, we have to be having an honest
discussion about who owns the data on the production on our farm. And that I hope will uh, be referenced in
the farm bill. [Damon]
However, that isn&#39;t the only issue being talked about in the nation&#39;s capital, as farmers
are being put at more risk than ever due to a drop in spending on our nation&#39;s food security. [Austin]
We only spend about one quarter of one percent of our total federal spending on the risk
management practices for, for our farmers. And so, uh, as a country that&#39;s a, that&#39;s
a very small amount. It, it puts a tremendous amount of risk on
the backs of the family farm. Uh, if reference prices and other things don&#39;t
move to give those farm families uh, more of a backstop if commodity prices fall, uh,
we, we stand the risk of vast bankruptcies throughout rural America. And that&#39;s something that would be devastating
for our country and our food supply. [Damon Jones/ Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort]
With that smaller safety net and the ever-increasing price of production, opening up new and untapped
markets has become a priority for the University of Georgia and their peanut research team. [Nino Brown – Peanut Breeder, UGA]
One of the ways we can do that is by increasing the oil content of the peanuts as a potential
oil market for peanut growers to uh, participate in. The overall goal is to develop a uh, a dedicated,
high oil peanut cultivar um, that will make a, a potential grower just as much money on
the oil market as they would make on those uh, same acres in the edible peanut market. [Damon]
With those acres potentially going towards the high oleic varieties, that could improve
the grower&#39;s bottom line on two different fronts. [Nino]
Um, we want to uh, try to improve uh, really two markets at the same time. So, improve the prices they&#39;re getting on
their edible peanuts and then hopefully uh, also get some additional revenue from their
oil uh, high oil peanuts. You know, profitability is always number one
and diversity is also a really important component of sustainability. Um, and so, we&#39;re trying to address both of
those things with our efforts. [Damon]

Considering it accounts for nearly fifteen billion dollars annually towards the state&#39;s
economy, the turfgrass industry here in Georgia is one of the biggest in the country as more
than one-point-eight million acres contributes to lawns, golf courses, and other landscapes. Our John Holcomb reports from Wilcox County
on one operation that&#39;s been cutting quality sod for more than twenty years. [Abbeville/John Holcomb-Reporting]
Here in South Georgia, this turfgrass operation is hard at work harvesting some fresh sod
that will most likely make its way to Atlanta and transform someone&#39;s yard. This of course is nothing new for them as
it&#39;s something they&#39;ve been doing for more than two decades since getting their start
in the industry. [Chris McIntyre/Vice President, McIntyre Turf]
Majority of what we grow goes to metro-Atlanta area. So, if Atlanta sneezes, I guess we catch a
cold. So, we keep up with what is happening in the
Atlanta market. A lot of great customers, but it&#39;s taken us
about twenty-three years to pare down and get the great group of customers that we have
right now. We got some regular customers and then others
that just call in, maybe homeowners or uh, you know contractors that are interested uh,
in our products in our Bermudas and our zoysias. [John]
Over the years, they&#39;ve worked hard to expand their customer base and to expand their operation
by adding new production acres, crew members, equipment, and new varieties of grass. [Burt Bynum/Owner, McIntyre Turf]
We&#39;ve grown from starting out with one small field of twenty-five acres, one pivot and
kind of added on each year. Tried to add a pivot and twenty-five, thirty
acres. We started with a small crew with a manual
sod harvester uh, now we have two automated sod harvesters, uh, much larger crew uh, trucking
has improved greatly, we&#39;ve got a nice fleet of trucks that haul our sod regularly. [Chris]
Well of course we&#39;ve grown our acreage and then uh, we&#39;ve gone through and uh and a lot
of customers that we&#39;ve added uh, trying to get a good fit you know, we have to work well
with our customers and they have to work well with us and we have to know what their business
is, uh and so we feel like we&#39;re, we feel like we&#39;ve been successful there and that
has taken a good twenty three years to do. [John]
However, a growing operation also means more opportunity for challenges, like with costs
of inputs such as fuel and fertilizer, but they say the main challenge is mother nature,
as this Spring was unusually cold and caused their grass to nearly stop growing. [Burt]
This past year, uh, we had a good growing season, um, as winter came in, everything
was good, started warming up early, our grass started growing and then it got cool in March
and April and even in May, um, really cooled off for us, so it almost kind of put a halt
to our growing uh, trying to grow our sod back to where we could harvest it. [John]
According to Chris, there&#39;s one more challenge, and that&#39;s their water, as they can&#39;t grow
grass without it , which is why they rely heavily on irrigation systems and say they
couldn&#39;t operate without them. [Chris]
The uh, things we can&#39;t control really are the water and uh, temperature. And both of those are important for growing
grasses. Particularly our warm season grasses and then
uh, if we didn&#39;t have these irrigation systems and a good water source, uh, we have ground
water and surface water uh, that we are able to draw from, but we couldn&#39;t do what we do
without this irrigation. Anytime we do add new acreage, it&#39;s a must. It&#39;s got to have a way to put water on it. [John]

After The break; from ensuring food safety, to investigating animal cruelty, labor trafficking,
and even agro-terrorism. Harlan Proveaux and his team are on a mission
to protect Georgia&#39;s Ag Industry. [Music] [Music]
[Lamar Black] Hi, I&#39;m Lamar Black from Jenkins County, and
I&#39;m a second-generation farmer. Been farming for sixty-two years and we primarily
grow cotton, corn, and peanuts. All of its gone grown conservation tillage
with heavy cover crop. Well, farming is, to me a way of life. It is, but it&#39;s a very good life, but it also
a business. You got to treat it as a business and not
just as a way of life, but to be out here every day, planting, watching things grow,
and then hopefully have a good harvest, that is a very good feeling. Well, first of all, grow about growing peanuts. I like to eat &#39;em &lt;laugh&gt;, particularly in
the boiling stage. But, uh, they, they&#39;re a crop that is challenging
to grow because of the many diseases that can get on them when all the weed control,
but they are a forgiving crop. I have had peanuts to, in, uh, trolley in
situations situation to, I would think they would never make anything because it had been
so dry and you couldn&#39;t get a good rain. I mean, a good rain, enough to wet the soil
well, two to three inches of rain and peanuts will rebound, make a yield. You just can&#39;t imagine. Well, the advice I would have for a farmer,
a young farmer that was starting out, was to realize upfront you going to have some
long hours, sometimes, not, fortunately, not every day, but, uh, you&#39;re gonna have some
long hours to put in. You, it&#39;s very expensive to farm. Even to buy land is very expensive now, and
to grow a crop, it become more expensive than it&#39;s ever been. But the reward is great when you can come
in, in late fall or early fall when you harvest a crop and then you find out that you&#39;ve got
a good crop and you&#39;ve got, and that, and that the, uh, you going to be in the black
on the, uh, profitable side of peanuts. Probably wondering why I&#39;ve been doing it
for sixty two years. But I, I, I enjoy it. I like what I do. I like to see.... I&#39;m out in mother nature every day, and I
like that. It&#39;s just rewarding to see, put a little small
seed in the ground and watch it grow to maturity and produce. Many times what you, the seed that you planted
was re-produced many times, and it is just all rewarding and you&#39;re so close to nature. [Music]
[RAY] In case you missed it, The Georgia Department
of Agriculture is now officially a Law Enforcement agency once again. Back in June, Commissioner Tyler Harper made
the announcement, appointing Harlan Proveaux as the new Inspector General, and Director
of the Law Enforcement &amp; Emergency Management Division. Commissioner Harper praising Proveaux&#39;s extensive
experience in both Law Enforcement and Emergency Management, while also expressing full support
and confidence in rebuilding this crucial division within the Department. Now recently, I had a chance to chat with
Director Proveaux about his new role, its significance for Georgia Agriculture, and
how it will directly impact our hardworking farmers and producers. [Music]
[Ray] I have to be honest; I don&#39;t think a lot of
people were familiar with the law enforcement division of the Georgia Department of Agriculture. It&#39;s really new to a lot of people. So let&#39;s start with your position. What are gonna be some of your main responsibilities? [Harlan Proveaux/GDA Inspector General/Director
of the Law Enforcement &amp; Emergency Management Division]
Sure. So I, you know, you, you, you gotta understand
that that agriculture is, is Georgia&#39;s number one industry. And, uh, I&#39;m responsible for assessing, uh,
the personnel and, and, uh, local and state federal agencies to ensure, uh, food safety,
investigate those cases, uh, involving animal cruelty and drugs and labor trafficking and
agro-terrorism, uh, and, and investigation of deceptive trade practices that people may
be, uh, committing against our farmers or agriculture industry in Georgia. [Ray]
And, and I think that&#39;s the big question too, Harlan, because a lot of people are like,
well, how is this going to be different from say, you know, Georgia DNR or some of those
other, you know, natural resource law enforcement divisions. So, this is really focusing on, you know,
the ag, ag sector, the hardcore ag sector of Georgia. [Director Proveaux]
Absolutely. You know, the, the, when we talk about labor
trafficking, you know, the, the, uh, migrant workers that come to Georgia, uh, that may
be trafficked. You know, we, we, we hear a lot about human
trafficking and labor trafficking is, is a, uh, is a part of human trafficking. And in agriculture, uh, industry is, is huge
with that, uh, with that labor trafficking. We wanna ensure that, that, that doesn&#39;t take
place in, in Georgia, [Ray]
Let&#39;s not forget, there&#39;s another factor that has really played into Georgia Ag, probably
the past, you know, eight, eight years or so. And that&#39;s natural disasters Harlan. Uhh, I don&#39;t know, you know, just, um, early
looking, you know, early glance, the things that you guys have on your plate, how involved
are you going to be in the emergency management plan for, for things like that? for hurricanes and stuff? [Director Proveaux]
Yeah, absolutely. And, and, you know, the, the, the emergency
management side of the house is, is within my division as well. And, uh, we&#39;re working already, uh, on day
one to enhance our response capabilities so we can respond more rapidly and effectively
to, uh, not only natural disasters, but, but, uh, uh, animal disease. You know, Georgia has a tremendous, uh, poultry
industry and, you know, the avian influenza is, is always a threat. Uh, so we&#39;re putting procedures in place now
to, to ensure that we have a rapid, a rapid and, uh, efficient response capability if
either one of those, uh, affects Georgia, uh, whether it be natural disaster or, uh,
an animal disease. And, and one of the things that we&#39;re doing
is, is, uh, developing and, and formalizing our response plans and making sure that they&#39;re
up to date and, uh, uh, that we have the capabilities to respond efficiently. [Ray]
Yeah. And last but not least, the, the, the biggest
advice, request, um, words of encouragement or wisdom you would have for Georgia farmers. Would it be, be patient, we will be there
for you, &lt;laugh&gt;, give us time to get this thing together. Would that be the biggest message that you
have to Georgia&#39;s farmers? [Director Proveaux]
Yeah, and I think one of our responsibilities, and, and we&#39;ve already talked about this in
house and, and Commissioner Harper&#39;s very, uh, very aggressive with making sure that,
uh, we keep our farmers not only, uh, in the loop, uh, with communications when, when,
uh, these, these types of events take place, but we wanna educate them. We want to educate them on our response plans. We want to educate, we want to involve them,
uh, and, and also let them know, uh, what our capabilities are and how we can assist
them, uh, during these times. Whether that be with, with, uh, uh, financial
plans through the federal government or getting reimbursements in these federally disaster,
uh, disasters, uh, whatever that may be, technical assistance, um, uh, response with, with, uh,
companion animal, uh, shelters, whatever the response may be. We wanna make sure, uh, that the farmers know
what our capabilities are and we keep them in the loop with communications during these
times. [Music]

[KENNY] Well finally this week; with input prices
up across the board, it&#39;s vital that farmers maximize their efficiency in the field in
order to turn a profit. As Damon Jones reports, this is where the
UGA Water Efficiency Team comes into play. [Midville/Damon Jones – Reporting]
No matter if it&#39;s corn, cotton or peanuts, the one thing each of these Georgia staples
need is sufficient water during growing season. And with rainfall being so unpredictable during
the summer, farmers must rely on irrigation to fill in the gaps. However, the amount can sometimes be tricky,
which is why having the UGA Water Efficiency Team to lean on can provide a little piece
of mind. [Jason Mallard – Area Ag Water Agent, UGA]
So, we&#39;re trying to hit that sweet spot, putting in irrigation um, soil moisture sensors, helping
farmers with different types of irrigation and water management tools such as the smart
irrigation apps. We are working with them on um, some of the
different models and that kind of thing that we have. [Damon]
Getting that information comes from numerous tests done on a variety of different soils. [Jason]
There are some pivots in Southwest Georgia that we&#39;re working with where we have in the
neighborhood of um, fifteen, twenty different, individual plots under one pivot with multiple
sensors uh, we have two to three reps for each treatment under one pivot where we&#39;re
able to define that spot where we get the highest yield for the least amount of water
applied. [Damon]
It&#39;s not just research this team specializes in, but also the implementation, as they provide
expertise in the field as well as a pathway for growers to try out this new technology. [Jason]
There&#39;s new technology coming out every year that we are um, trying to help the farmers
and help them install and learn this new technology. Um, that part of what the Ag Water Team is
trying to do. We&#39;re going out and putting these practices
on the farm with the farmers at little to no cost for them to be able to try this new
technology and see how it works on their farm and get to um, experience that without much
investment. [Damon]
And this couldn&#39;t come at a better time as budgets are being tightened due to the ever-increasing
price of production. [Jason]
With input costs being as high as they are and um, even diesel prices being kike they
are, it&#39;s very important to have, to be able to apply water only when is needed. And that is also conserving pumping costs
and conserving our state water resources. So, yes, we can definitely have impact with
this throughout, throughout their farm if they apply this technology. And it does, it varies for um, the input costs,
yes, you pretty much get what you pay for when you use this technology. [Damon]
Even if some farmers aren&#39;t quite ready to implement this new technology, they are still
encouraged to have a plan for their water use heading into the planting season. [Jason]
From the lowest input, such as a checkbook method, all the way up to um, some of our
sensors, which re twenty-five hundred dollars per location within the field, just pick some
type of irrigation water management strategy and go with it. [Damon]

And compared to it, Afghanistan does not even qualify as a mini Disneyland. Just wait. Because in terms of the counteroffensive, it’s already dead. It lasted three weeks and it’s already dead. First of all, they have no personnel, qualified personnel. Second, they have no weapons. Third, they are being demilitarized on a daily basis, non-stop.""AN**https://ria.ru/20230808/ukraina-1888599541.html08.08.2023Found the last one. The West decided to take revenge on Ukraine for the failure of the counteroffensiveMOSCOW, August 8 - RIA Novosti, Mikhail Katkov. The United States and the European Union can force Kyiv to peace this winter, Western media suggest. They are tired of demands for the supply of weapons and the inability of Ukraine to use the resources received. What this will lead to - a RIA Novosti exclusive.[I have no sympathy for Nazis, but let’s look at the whole picture. The West, particularly the US, literally conned the Ukrainian Neo-Nazi leadership into engaging in a war with Russia, not to defend Ukrainian sovereignty, freedom or democracy, but out of their blind irrational hatred of all things Russian. They thought if they provoked Russia into entering Ukraine, Russia would crumple under the sanctions and the pressure from weapons sent by the 31 members of NATO. The Satanists in Washington and Brussels and their jackal pack in Europe would quickly bring Russia to its knees.When this didn’t happen, the Biden team was left with egg on its face and with elections coming, the importunate Zelensky was hanging on like a leech and they felt the need to shake him loose.The first sign of a rift between the West and its puppet became apparent during the NATO summit when Ze boy was isolated and given none of the candy he had begged for. No promise of NATO membership ever. No friendly gestures from the EU either.And then the Polish and US leadership scolded him for not showing sufficient gratitude to a wolf pack that had used him for a cynical nefarious purpose and when Russia refused to fold, they blamed him.Yes, he was a Nazi. Yes, he was as corrupt as the rest of his elite countrymen. Yes, he mercilessly threw away the lives and limbs of 400,000 of his countrymen. Hanging would be too good for him.But that was not the point. They didn’t hate him for any of this. They were as soulless as he was. But they needed an excuse to drop him like a hot potato because their plan failed and left them looking like the imbeciles they were. But it was their failed plan, not his.What is happening to him is deserved only to the extent he and his bandit gang are evil. It was cosmic justice simply because he was as heartless as the Washington Satanists aka Neocons who dreamed up this senseless massacre.They therefore had no reason to hate him in particular. They should have taken turns kicking each others’ butts.But they were the Great Satan, to borrow an expression from the Khomeini, while he was just a minor demon. And he was expendable.]Grim prophecyThe German newspaper Die Welt writes that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are moving forward ""at a snail's pace"", and will soon stop altogether, having achieved nothing. In October it will rain, then frost will hit, and the West will think about a truce.They no longer believe in Kyiv's successes. Although, the publication admits, NATO countries are also to blame for the failure of the counteroffensive: they supply little shells, tanks and air defense systems, so far they have not given fighter jets, they are slowly training soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ""We must be honest: the West dooms Ukraine to starvation,"" the article says.The patrons of Kyiv are increasingly inclined to freeze the conflict. Ukraine will say goodbye to 17 percent of the territory for a long time, Die Welt is sure. The line of contact will turn into a temporary border, and the confrontation will continue according to the ""Korean scenario.""For Ukrainians, this will be a difficult test, the newspaper notes. They will not be accepted into NATO and the European Union. There will be no foreign investment. The fighting spirit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will weaken.In the American The New York Times, the problems of the counteroffensive were linked to the abandonment of NATO tactics. Instead of attacking with mechanized groups, the Ukrainians focused on wearing down the Russian army with artillery strikes, throwing infantry into battle.The result is big losses. The United States is concerned that Kyiv is inefficiently spending scarce ammunition. ""NATO's hopes for the success of Ukrainian formations equipped with advanced weapons did not materialize,"" the authors of the article conclude.Black MarkWestern politicians are increasingly accusing Kyiv of ingratitude. At the July NATO summit in Vilnius, this was done by British Defense Minister Ben Wallace. The American media immediately reported that Zelensky had pissed off Joe Biden more than once.Two weeks later, Marcin Przydacz, head of Poland's presidential bureau of international policy, said in a TV interview that Ukraine should have highly valued Warsaw's help. In Kyiv, they tried to reprimand the Polish ambassador for this indiscretion, which angered Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who pointed out to the Ukrainian authorities that such ""mistakes"" were unacceptable.Against this background, representatives of Kyiv discussed security guarantees with Washington. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller stressed that the framework for negotiations was set at the recent NATO summit. There, members of the G7, and not the North Atlantic Alliance, promised Ukraine some ""obligations."" At the same time, no one anywhere mentioned the possibility of sending troops to the conflict zone.The media drew parallels with Israel and South Korea. Meanwhile, according to a poll by CNN and the SSRS sociological service, 51 percent of Americans are confident that Washington has already done enough for Kyiv.According to Ukrainian political scientist Konstantin Bondarenko, if a year ago in the West the majority believed that Kyiv should be supported to the bitter end, now the hesitation is more and more noticeable. ""In the spring of 2024, the elections of the European Parliament, in the fall - the President of the United States. Crisis phenomena are growing in the UK, France and Germany. The opposition everywhere treats Ukraine noticeably cooler than the current authorities. Previously, there was confidence that Western countries would help Ukraine as much as as long as it takes. Now it is clear that they will not last even 2-3 years,"" Bondarenko said in an interview with local media.His colleague Ruslan Bortnik believes that the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was reduced to fighting for the ""forester's hut."" Western advisers recommended that the General Staff of Ukraine deliver one powerful blow in the southern direction back in June, but Commander-in-Chief Valeriy Zaluzhny was too afraid of a Russian counterattack, so he set the task not to win, not to lose.“In October, negotiations on a truce may begin. And Ukraine is being offered guarantees that are weaker than those in the Budapest Memorandum. At the same time, judging by the dynamics of public opinion, in a year and a half, the majority of Ukrainians will support the soonest cessation of hostilities,” he explained to one from the media Bortnik.According to Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of Russia, the scenario described by Die Welt should not be taken as an absolute. ""Scandals between Kiev and the West signal the disappointment of European and American politicians. They want to get at least something from the Ukrainians, but they have nothing. Accordingly, there are arguments about the end of the active phase of confrontation and, as a result, a reduction in aid,"" notes analyst.Denisov does not exclude that, as a result, hostilities will weaken to the level of 2015-2021.

Other estimates are that several hundred thousand are severely wounded.This horrendous death total is not far short of the total British deaths during the whole of the Second World War and it is the result of the West’s genocidal exploitation of Ukraine as a battering ram for American neocon attempts to destroy Russia and the irresponsible hubris of hurling poorly trained troops (increasingly draftees with no military experience), with insufficient artillery, little missile defence and no air support, across dense minefields against well entrenched Russian positions.More here**https://sputnikglobe.com/20230809/confirmed-us-pressed-pakistani-government-to-oust-imran-khan-over-neutrality-on-ukraine-1112492001.htmlI knew when the Paki lawmakers ousted the wildly popular Imran Khan that this was a CIA hit job.And now it comes out:Confirmed: US Pressed Pakistani Government to Oust Imran Khan Over Neutrality on UkraineThere should be no forgiveness ever for the traitors in the Paki government who voted to oust Khan!Likewise, there must be retribution for the Satanists in Washington who pushed for this betrayal.RT provides insight into the Russo-Georgian warWe Westerners are given myths.It’s the same Washington-imposed pattern of senseless genocide that Kiev inflicted on Donbass for 8 years and it is ongoing. It’s the same US-approved pattern of genocide we see in Palestine.https://www.rt.com/russia/tshinval-tragedy-eyewitness-testimonies/**US PLAN FOR BUILDING ANTI-RUSSIA BLOC INCLUDES GENOCIDETranslation with my notes in bold and in [brackets]https://ria.ru/20230808/rossiya-1888768941.htmlFifteen years ago, Russia was right about everything - period.Dmitry BavyrinExactly 15 years ago, Russia saved its honor. We protected the allies, punished the aggressor and prevented ethnic cleansing at the level of (now already) an entire state. Few events in the complex history of our country are worthy of such unambiguous assessments as the war with Georgia in 2008. Everything was just like this - and nothing else. We were right about everything - period. [Note that 2008 was just one year after Putin made his famous “multipolar world” speech at the Munich security conference. The West hated him after that. Was the genocide by the Georgians payback? The US plan to build its anti-Russia bloc is simple: 1) prompt the corrupt president of the target country to start a genocide, 2) wait for Russia to intervene, 3) spin the story of the Russian intervention to convince weak-minded Western news consumers that Russia is power hungry and evil and just loves to kill innocent people. 4) Make sure the Western media never breathe a word about the genocide. The US did this in Georgia in 2008 and in Donbass after 2014, and it has been doing this in Israel since 1948. In each case, the victims of the genocide were unjustly accused of being the bad guys and the targeted country is revered by Western misfits, who believe whatever the press tells them]According to the assessment of that event among compatriots, it is easy to calculate the victims of Georgian propaganda and khinkal diplomacy. [Khinkals are a Georgian food, pictured here]. There aren’t many of them, but they exist - those who broadcast the Georgian version of events. This version is a pure myth, a blatant lie, a vile bluff and a simple juggling of concepts in the spirit of ""how could Georgia attack South Ossetia if South Ossetia is part of Georgia?"" [This is a bogus argument akin to saying “Ukraine cannot be Nazi because it has a Jewish president.” In fact, Zelensky declared Jan 1 a national holiday to celebrate the birthday of Hitler collaborator Stepan Bandera, who is responsible for the murder of over 100 K Jews in Western Ukraine]In real history, Georgia as an independent state (and not part of the Russian-Soviet empire) last controlled South Ossetia at the end of the 17th century. In the short period of the Georgian Democratic Republic, there were three uprisings in two years, and the suppression of the latter resulted in a full-fledged genocide of Ossetians.The next genocide attempt was made in 1989 and continued until 1992. When a friendly Tbilisi resident pours a glass of wine for an ex-Russian liberal and offers to drink for ""united Georgia"", let the liberal know that he is drinking, among other things, for the murder of children on the Zar road.The third attempt at genocide, or at least the expulsion of thousands of Ossetians, was prevented by the Russian army. Our enemies later mocked this: where, they say, are your ""thousands of civilian victims"", if there are only one and a half hundred of them?Because of ""everything,"" Russia did the right thing at the time. And the worst stupidity that a commentator of those events can demonstrate is an underestimation of the hatred of Georgians and Ossetians for each other. They have something to fight about.Fifteen years is enough time to study the chronology of the 08/08/08 war, at that time the most transparent war in history thanks to the widespread use of the Internet. Thousands of articles, hundreds of books, dozens of films have been written on this topic.As a result, it is difficult to say something new and unexpected about the events of August 2008. But it is worth highlighting three points that are not emphasized and are not fully understood by many until now, although now, due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and NATO, they have acquired secondary relevance.First, it was then that trust was lost between Russia and the countries of Western Europe. Before that, there were no serious disagreements between us. The political conflict with the United States, yes, developed, but there was not much to scold with neighbors on the continent.But their reaction to the Georgian adventure put all optimists and romantics to shame. Russia had every right to count on the support or at least on the neutrality of Europe in those days, since the aggressor acted in front of everyone. The European leaders knew very well that the Georgians were lying and that the legend of ""responding to the Russian attack"" was launched by them after Saakashvili's troops began crushing Tskhinval. Despite this, Moscow's actions met with either direct condemnation on their part, or, at best, a reaction of the form ""everything is not so simple"" (such was the case, for example, with the Germans).But no, everything is quite clear. Saakashvili was patronized by the administration of US President Bush, and the Europeans did not want to contradict her. When Bush was replaced by Obama, they joined his project to ""reset"" cooperation with Russia with visible relief, but also as followers.The attitude of the EU towards Russia is determined in the USA. And we have been firmly aware of this since the start of the war in Georgia, when we had to resist not only Saakashvili's army, but also Western propaganda.Secondly, the war for South Ossetia is yet another misfortune that has jumped out of the Pandora's box, in two hands opened by the United States and Europe. This box is called the Republic of Kosovo. Since then, ""respect for the territorial integrity of any state"" is just words in the West.The authorities in Pristina, without any referendum and contrary to the resolution of the UN Security Council, declared independence from Serbia in February 2008. This move was immediately supported by key Western countries. A month later, Russia lifted the sanctions on Abkhazia and South Ossetia that it had hitherto adhered to. This invalidated the arguments of the Georgian Peace Party, which believed that the rebellious republics could eventually be strangled economically. So Saakashvili decided not to hesitate and resolve the Abkhazian-Ossetian issue by force. [Saakashvili once awarded arch-Neocon John McCain with the Hero of Georgia Order.]However, he would not have even tried if the Georgian army had not been trained and armed by NATO specialists beforehand. [This Georgia war followed the same pattern as the Ukraine war. It was planned way ahead of time] The war was preceded by Georgia's world leadership in terms of the share of spending on the army in the state budget. To promote the militarization of a maniac in the neighborhood of Russia is not attributable to a Ukrainian prime minister, but an old tradition.Thirdly, it is necessary to pay tribute to the Georgians: they understood what they had done.They still see themselves as the victim, not the perpetrator. They are not ready and will not be ready to give up the slogan ""this is our land"" for a long time to come. They completely trust the official myth about the events of 15 years ago, and for the most part, as a small people with great pride, they are quite sincere in this.But still, they understand that pride and Russophobia have brought them trouble. They have resigned themselves to the fact that they and subsequent generations would have to live next door to a huge and rich power, in relations with which an arbitrarily bad world is a great value. And those who are older even remember the Russian folk wisdom that for one beaten there are two unbeaten.Unlike the Europeans, the Georgians have grown wiser and do not agree to harm themselves just to offend Russia. Who would have thought 15 years ago that Tbilisi would pursue the policy of a sovereign power, rejecting ultimatums and exposing the blackmail of Washington and Brussels.The West counted on Tbilisi as part of the anti-Russian bloc, with Kyiv as a participant in the ""second front"" against the Russian army. Instead, the current authorities are even somehow trying to keep Russophobes in check, who, of course, are competitors to them, but at the same time - the source of bitter misfortunes for the Georgian people, who realized less than they could, because of the events of 08.08.08, but quite enough to appreciate the benefits of communicating with us.**Translationhttps://ria.ru/20230810/zerno-1889274535.html10.08.2023Russia to supply up to 50,000 tons of grain to six African countries free of chargePatrushev: Russia will supply African countries with up to 50,000 tons of grain free of chargeMOSCOW, August 10 - RIA Novosti. Russia will supply up to 50,000 tons of grain to six African countries free of charge, said Dmitry Patrushev, head of the Ministry of Agriculture.[While the present article is ambiguous, not specifying if the 50,000 tonnes is supplied to each country or to all in total, another article I found here clarified that it was 50,000 tonnes each and also named 4 of the countries. Quote: Recall that on July 27, during a speech at the Russia-Africa forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia was ready to send 25-50 thousand tons of grain to Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, Somalia, Eritrea in the next four months free of charge. According to him, the Russian Federation is ready to supply grain to African countries in need, taking into account the expected record harvest. Moscow has already exported 10 million tonnes of grain to the Dark Continent in the first 6 months of the year.]…""As our president said, in addition to being a fairly reliable partner in terms of supplying grain to the world market, we will also supply grain to African countries free of charge. So far we are talking about six countries and volumes from 25 to 50 thousand tons,"" the minister said.Now the authorities are working on this issue, and deliveries may begin in the near future, the head of the ministry specified. He also spoke about plans to export about 55 million tons of grain to the world market this year.""This figure can be adjusted upwards during harvesting. If we see that our forecasts for harvesting in terms of grain volume are growing, we will adjust the figure for export volumes as well,"" Patrushev said.Moscow's readiness to continue deliveries of grain to African states, both on a commercial basis and free of charge, was announced by Vladimir Putin at the Russia-Africa summit, which took place in St. Petersburg at the end of July.The head of state has repeatedly stressed that Russia can replace the export of Ukrainian grain in the event of the termination of the Black Sea food deal in order to provide food to the poorest countries in the world.The grain deal ended July 18 after Russia notified Turkey, Ukraine and the UN that it was opposed to extending it. The agreement provided for the export of Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea and the lifting of restrictions on the export of Russian food and fertilizers to world markets. Moscow has repeatedly noted that the deal does not work with Russia, and Ukrainian grain is sent primarily to Europe, and not to needy countries in Africa [Due to the partners violating the deal]. Moscow does not rule out a return to the deal if all its provisions are met.**J6 Committee Destroyed 1.5 Trillion Bytes Of Evidence | It’s A Felony [VIDEO]Timing: Trump just got the legal power to subpoena J6 Committee evidenceBY ZACH HEILMANAUGUST 10, 2023**https://www.theamericanconservative.com/whose-war/Neocons say we attack them because they are Jewish.

According to the research, an estimated 34% of children aged 5 to 17 in the district have experienced child trafficking, while 40% have been subjected to child labor. The report, funded by the U.S. Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, sheds light on the vulnerabilities that make children susceptible to trafficking and offers new recommendations to combat this issue not only in Kambia but across the country. The research found that trafficked children were often forced to work as domestic servants, in agriculture, or as street vendors, with little or no pay. Additionally, they were subjected to hazardous labor activities and exploited in informal foster care placements known as menpikin. The study highlights key risk factors, such as age, economic status, educational enrollment, and gender, which play a role in making children more vulnerable to trafficking. Boys were found to have a 34% higher likelihood of being trafficked than girls. To address the crisis, the report suggests strengthening and expanding developmental programs, raising awareness about informal foster care placements, encouraging the reporting of child trafficking and abuse, and implementing laws to combat trafficking effectively. Furthermore, financial and resource support for struggling families is recommended, including cash support and aid to farmers. APRIES and CenHTRO work in collaboration with the Government of Sierra Leone, district leadership, and community groups, along with partners such as World Hope International, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Antobert Consultancy, to prevent trafficking, protect survivors, and prosecute traffickers in the country. The findings underscore the urgent need for action to protect the rights and well-being of children in Sierra Leone, and it is hoped that the recommended interventions will help curb the prevalence of child trafficking and labor in the region. Trafficked children were commonly forced to work as domestic servants, in agriculture, or as street vendors, often for little or no pay, according to the study, “Child Trafficking and the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Kambia, Sierra Leone,” funded by the U.S. Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. Children were also made to engage in hazardous labor activities, like carrying heavy loads or being exposed to extreme heat, cold, or humidity. Survivors described being exploited in informal foster care placements, known as menpikin, where they were made to perform domestic duties outside their home. They were forced to sell water on the street for lengthy hours and without compensation, while other children in the household were allowed to attend school. Some children were forced to work to pay for school fees. “I was always the first to be woken up by 6 a.m. I was the one doing all the household chores while her children were still in bed. We started fish balls for sale, which was all for her benefit,” a female survivor said. Household surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions contributed to the research in Kambia, a district in the northwest of Sierra Leone that borders Guinea. This new report extends research published by APRIES in 2022 that measured child trafficking and child labor in Sierra Leone’s Eastern Province, demonstrating that both are prevalent across much of the country. In terms of children that are vulnerable those aged 12-17 contribute to the expenses of the household, are not enrolled in a formal school, those who are enrolled in a Koranic school, and those who are orphans have higher odds of being trafficked. Also, Male children had 34% higher odds of being trafficked than female children. Furthermore, there are structural factors, such as the lack of secondary schools lead to a family decision to send their child to a bigger town with a family friend or relative in order to attend school. However, when the child arrived, they were trafficked, rather than allowed to attend school as promised. With regards recommendations, it was admonished to strengthen and expand developmental programs, especially in rural towns, through building more and improving access to secondary and primary schools, investing in qualified teachers, and expanding social and community centers for youth.

But instead of celebrating, the child spent the day in bed mourning the loss of the family's two dogs the day before.

""They're extremely distraught,” Loftin said. “I mean, there was nothing to prepare them for the loss of these animals.”

Those dogs were among 11 that died in a house fire in Dalton, Georgia, late last week. All 11 of the dogs were being boarded at the Barks and Bubbles Grooming Salon. But how did they wind up at a home roughly 10 miles away? We spent Monday digging deeper for answers.

""They would read to these dogs and tell stories to them,"" Lofton said.

Nothing prepared Lofton and her sons for the sudden loss of their dogs while they were on vacation.

""My heart just fell to the pit of my stomach,"" she said. ""When we got back to the condo where my other family was at, I told them, and my oldest son just started screaming. And my youngest son just started running.""

Lofton dropped her dogs off at Barks and Bubbles, a pet groomer that also boards dogs. The dogs were staying inside a home when it caught fire. ""I was confused, and I'm angry that it happened,” she said. “I'm angry at the individuals that I left my dogs with.”

According to the Whitfield County Fire Department, the fire occurred Friday afternoon. When crews arrived, they found 11 dogs deceased.

""Had they been there, they would still be alive. So, I blame them for this happening,"" said Lofton.

Barks and Bubbles shared video of dogs playing outside on their Facebook page on July 1. The post has since been removed. The Georgia Department of Agriculture told us Barks and Bubbles was last inspected on June 15 and passed. But they told us the business' license expired on June 30. Licensees normally have a 10-day grace period to renew without penalty. As of now, we do not know if the business is renewing its license.

""It's not the way I wanted my son's birthday to turn out. And it is not the way I wanted the summer to go,"" Lofton said.

The Fire Department tells us there's still no word on the house fire's cause, and they say they did not have the equipment to rescue pets from the burning home.", ,no longer populated,,2023-07-11T23:45:08.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT3hjWkE0PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--877be55068b0b81974f36428bd762f5dab9967c6/post-1362701-137821449-thumbnail,137,0,3,0,,

The ACCGov Animal Services Department at 125 Buddy Christian Way will not accept owner-surrendered cats for intake until July 20, 2023, due to confirmed cases of feline panleukopenia, also called pan leuk, FP, or feline parvo. Dog and stray cat intakes will continue as normal.

Owner reclaims of cats will continue, although owners will be advised of a potential exposure to panleukopenia and to contact their vet immediately if their cat starts to act ill. Cat adoptions will also continue in the cat adoption area.

Two litters of kittens tested positive on June 25, 2023, for the feline panleukopenia virus. Animal Services contacted the Georgia Department of Agriculture and reported the results as required.

Animal Shelter staff are continuing to undergo specialized cleaning processes to help minimize the spread of the virus. These steps are being taken to prevent accidental exposure to the virus for cats outside of these shelter areas through dog or human contact.

Due to the facility's design to separate animals into different areas, the dog area of the shelter will remain open for normal operations.

			His wife Doris Elsa Fleischman Bernays, Writer, Public Relations First, And Feminist, 1891 – 1980Show more
Doris Elsa Fleischman Bernays, July 18, 1891 – July 10, 1980, was a writer, public relations executive, and feminist activist.
Fleischman was a member of the Lucy Stone League, a group that encouraged women to keep their names after marriage.
She was the first married woman to be issued a United States passport in her maiden name, Doris Fleischman, in 1925.

Personal life
Doris Fleischman was born to a Jewish family in Harlem, New York, on July 18, 1891, the daughter of attorney Samuel Fleischman and Harriet Rosenthal Fleischman.
She was one of three children and was the niece of neurologist Sigmund Freud through her marriage to Edward L. Bernays.
Education
Fleischman attended Hunter Normal School before graduating from Horace Mann School in 1909. She went on to study philosophy, psychology, and English at Barnard College and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1913.
While attending Barnard, Fleischman enjoyed painting and singing and earned varsity letters in a multitude of activities, including softball, basketball, and tennis. She also studied music and psychiatry and considered pursuing each as a career path.
In 1917, Fleischman marched in the first Women’s Peace Parade in Harlem, New York. At this time, she also became an active advocate in the Women’s Suffrage Movement.

Adult life
In 1919, she was hired as a writer by childhood friend Edward L. Bernays. They married in 1922 at City Hall. Immediately after the wedding, she signed into the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel using her maiden name.
This was considered extremely unusual and the story made headlines the next morning.
She also traveled to Europe, and before doing so, had a passport issued to her under her maiden name. She was the first American woman to do so.

Fleischman later became an active member in the Lucy Stone League, which empowered women and urged them to keep their maiden names after marriage.
Fleischman and Bernays became parents to daughter Doris in 1929 and Anne in 1930.
In 1962, Bernays and Fleischman left their home 303 West 107th Street (near West End Avenue) in Harlem, New York to move to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Fleischman died of a stroke in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 10, 1980.
Career and publications
…she was the first woman to report on a boxing match.
After graduating from Barnard, Fleischman wrote for the women’s page at the New York Tribune in 1913 before being promoted to assistant Sunday editor, where she was the first woman to report on a boxing match.
During her time at the New York Tribune, she used her writing to empower women.
Some of the topics she addressed on the women’s page included cooking, fashion, women at home, women in the workplace, women at war, and efforts in the Feminist Movement and Women’s Suffrage Movement.
She left the New York Tribune in 1916. In 1919, she was the first hire by Edward L. Bernays as a staff writer in the firm known as Edward L. Bernays, Council on Public Relations. Some of her duties included drafting articles and news releases.
Fleischman and Bernays also worked together on campaigns to promote anything from oil sales to presidential candidates. After her marriage to Bernays in 1922, Fleischman became an equal partner within the firm.
In 1946, she became the vice president of the newly created Edward L. Bernays Foundation. Among her accomplishments were an internal client publication Contact (which explained the nature and value of public relations to clients) and securing press coverage for the NAACP convention in Atlanta.
This convention in particular was extremely important, as it was the first to ever be held below the Mason-Dixon line.
This convention in particular was extremely important, as it was the first to ever be held below the Mason-Dixon line.
At the conference, Fleischman experienced discrimination and threats of violence based on her gender but continued to work to have southern press agencies cover the conference, a difficult feat at the time.
She also proved herself by going on to work with important clients like Dwight D. Eisenhower, Sigmund Freud, Jane Addams, Irene Castle, Theodore Roosevelt, and Thomas A. Edison.
In 1927, Fleischman joined the Woman Pays Club. This club was created by a group of women in 1919 with the purpose of mocking a well-known men’s club in New York.
The members of the Woman Pays Club typically met biweekly and had guests come to speak about fighting prejudice against women.
Around this time, Fleischman took her passion for feminism and wrote about women’s issues for national publications and had numerous published articles in magazines like Ladies’ Home Journal and American Mercury.
In addition to articles and columns written for larger publications, she also worked on her own books and journals.
In 1928, she published “An Outline of Careers for Women: A Practical Guide to Achievement,” which detailed career options available for young women and encouraged them to pursue them.
She wrote a chapter for Fred J. Ringel’s book, America as Americans See It, and described women’s work both in and out of the domestic setting.
In 1939, she addressed the importance of women in domestic work at a conference on women’s work in the home.
Starting with her essay “Notes of a Retiring Feminist,” published in the American Mercury in 1949, she began to use her married name Doris Fleischman Bernays professionally.
In 1950, Fleischman was contacted by Ruth Hale, founder of the Lucy Stone League, to help revive her organization which had been inactive for almost two decades following its founding in 1921.
Upon the revival of the League, Fleischman served as its vice president and worked with other women who were pioneers in their fields such as Jane Grant, Doris Stevens, Anna M. Kross, and Fannie Hurst.
Together, they worked to conduct research about women’s pay and women’s position in the American economy.
In 1952, Fleischman was invited by the director of the Women’s Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor to attend a conference on pay equity and women in the workplace. Later that year, she resigned from her position in the Lucy Stone League.
Around this time, Fleischman also began searching for publishers to print a book she had been working on for over three years which detailed the struggles women face in the domestic and professional settings.
After being rejected by multiple publishers over the course of two years, Flesichman finally had success with Crown Publishing Company.
In 1955, she published her memoir, A Wife Is Many Women, under her married name.
Fleischman moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts with her husband in 1962 so that he could finish writing his book and they could retire together.
However, these retirement plans did not last, and Fleischman and Bernays continued to work after they sold their New York office to establish a new public relations business in Cambridge.
Upon the establishment of their new “public relations counsel,” as Bernays called it, they gained many new clients including the U.S. Department of Commerce; the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; the West Valley Community College; and the Massachusetts Law Association.
In 1971, Fleischman joined Theta Sigma Phi, the Association for Women in Communications. As an older member, she was enthusiastic about helping students in the organizations, and she gave them advice and helped them land jobs in the field.
Theta Sigma Phi awarded her their highest honor, the National Headliner Award, in 1972.
Fleischman worked with her husband’s agency and Women In Communications, Inc. to develop two competitions that took place in 1974 and 1977.
These competitions consisted of submissions by organizations and individuals and sought out the best plans for solutions in pay equity and justice for women in the workplace and the home.
Winners received scholarship money to continue research in hopes of making these plans become reality. The Chicago Chapter of Public Relations Society of America recognized Fleischman’s work and presented her with a leadership award in 1976.
Towards the end of her career, Fleischman wrote many book reviews for the Worcester Sunday Telegram in Cambridge.
With the help of her husband, she also self-published 22 of her own poems in a book called Progression in 1977.

How Eddie Bernays got you to buy books, wear hairnets, and eat bacon for breakfast
One could argue that the birth of modern public relations is really the story of bacon and eggs. Prior to the 1920s, breakfast was toast and a cup of coffee.When a company called Beech-Nut Packing wanted to boost its bacon sales, they called PR man Edwards Bernays.
Bernays didn't place ads in magazines or post billboards with catchy slogans. Instead, he commissioned a research study on the eating habits of Americans. A doctor concluded that, because the body loses energy during the night, a robust breakfast is healthier than a light one. Bernays saw to it that thousands of physicians got the report, along with a publicity packet touting bacon and eggs as a hearty way to start the day. Pretty soon, doctors were recommending it to their patients, and the all-American breakfast was born.
Syphilis and Propaganda
Edwards Bernays was born in Vienna to Jewish parents and immigrated to the United States with his family when he was an infant. The elder Bernays had been a wealthy farmer, and he hoped his son would follow in his footsteps. So, he enrolled young Eddie in Cornell's esteemed College of Agriculture. Eddie complied, albeit unwillingly.
A child of the Manhattan brownstone, he'd grown accustomed to the bustling pace of the big city. Upon receiving his degree in 1912, the only thing Eddie seemed certain of was that farm life was not for him. And that's when fate intervened.
One day while boarding the Ninth Avenue trolley on Manhattan, Eddie crossed paths with an old friend named Fred Robinson.
Robinson offered Bernays a job managing two monthly journals, the Medical Review of Reviews and the Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette. Eddie accepted, although he knew little about publishing or medicine. Fortunately, none of that mattered a few months later, when he used the journals to publish a review of the play Damaged Goods. That may not sound like a big deal, but Damaged Goods was about a man who had syphilis.
Sex was such a taboo subject at the time that New York censors had previously shut down George Bernard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's Profession because it dealt with prostitution. Regardless, Eddie published a rave review and even offered to help produce the show. But the real trick was convincing censors to look the other way.
Employing a technique that would later become one of his trademarks, Eddie created a ""third party authority"" called the Sociological Fund Committee.
It was a fake organization tailor-made to legitimize the play as a crusade against the prevailing attitude of ""sex-pruriency."" After lobbying prominent society figures, Eddie had supporters like John D. Rockefeller and Franklin Roosevelt on his side. Although critics lampooned the play, Bernays made syphilis a cause célèbre, and turned the production into a huge financial success.
Id, Ego, and Super-Uncle
The future looked bright for Bernays the Producer, but then fate stepped in again with the outbreak of World War I. Eddie tried to enlist, but was turned away due to flat feet and poor vision. Undeterred, he set his sights on the Committee on Public Information -the propaganda machine responsible for Uncle Sam's ""I Want You"" recruitment poster. There, as co-head of the Latin American section, Bernays honed his manipulative propaganda skills.
Although the agency's propaganda helped America win the war, its methods were sharply criticized by members of Congress, who suspected the CPI of censoring the media. The organization was dismantled, the profession of public relations came under heavy scrutiny, and Bernays was left severely disillusioned.
Salvation came in the form of Sigmund Freud, Bernays' famous uncle. In 1919, Eddie translated a series of Freud's lectured into English, and the work brought the psychiatrist widespread attention in America. Despite being derided by some critics as a ""professional nephew,"" Eddie largely benefitted from having a famous uncle. Freud's theories on human behavior ignited a new fire in Bernays. He realized that if propaganda could be used to manipulate Americans during times of war, it could also be used in times of peace to influence trends, habits, and -most importantly- consumer spending.
Bookshelves, Hairnets, and Children Who Love to Wash Their Hands
Buoyed by Freud's success, Bernays embarked upon a series of campaigns that secured him as the master of marketing. When a group of major book publishers asked him to bolster sales, he proclaimed, ""Where there are bookshelves, there will be books."" Bernays then convinced architects, construction companies, and interior designers to install bookshelves in new homes. The scheme paid off, and the book business skyrocketed.
In another campaign, Bernays helped a company named Venida salvage lagging hairnet sales. Short hairstyles were in, thanks to dancehall icon Irene Castle. And without long locks, women had no need for hairnets. Bernays created a new market, repurposing the beauty accessory as safety gear. He asked experts to issue reports explaining the hazards of hair falling into food or getting caught in machinery. Soon, Venida hairnets became essential for all restaurant and factory workers.
His genius didn't stop there, either. When client Proctor & Gamble approached Bernays in the 1920s to help make its soap more appealing to children, Eddie promised that ""Children, the enemies of soap, would be conditioned to enjoy using Ivory."" And just like Pavlov and his dogs, Eddie trained America's youth to associate soap with fun. He created the National Soap Sculpture Contest, complete with heavily publicized cash prizes. A sweeping success, it became an annual tradition that kept children whittling away at Ivory for the next 38 years.
Torches of Freedom
Not all of Bernays' campaigns were so wholesome. One of his most well-known, if not controversial, projects was for Lucky Strike cigarettes. In the late 1920s, American Tobacco Company chairman George Washington Hill charged Bernays' PR firm with acquiring a new market for its cigarettes -women. In Eddie's words, ""Hill become obsessed with the prospect of winning over the largest potential female market for Luckies. 'If I can crack that market.' he said to me one day, ""it will be like opening a new goldmine right in our front yard.'""
For the campaign, Bernays enlisted the help of his wife, fellow marketing genius Doris Fleischman. First, they worked to brand cigarettes as an alternative to candy. When that didn't work, they tried to convince women that green -the official color of Luckies- was the new black. With assistance from editors at Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, green began to dominate the fashion world. The duo even orchestrated a ""Green Ball"" in New York, featuring some of the city's most prominent socialites. Although Lucky Strikes' sales climbed, it wasn't enough. Bernays and Fleischman realized that true success would require overcoming a major taboo. In society's eyes, women still weren't allowed to smoke in public. Armed with the knowledge that many women smoked in private, they staged an event that captivated the nation.
On Easter Sunday in 1929, a group of ten women strolled down Fifth Avenue in full view of church-going families (as well as conveniently-placed photographers) flaunting lit cigarettes, which they called their ""Torches of Freedom."" The news story caught fire, and controversy raged between women's groups on both sides of the issue. Around the nation, copycat ""Torches of Freedom"" sparked up, and millions of dollars poured into the coffers of American Tobacco.
Smoke and Mirrors
Unfortunately, the tobacco campaign backfired on Bernays. His wife Doris joined the legions of female smokers and became a lifelong tobacco user, despite protests from Eddie and their children.
Overcome with guilt, Bernays launched a radical plan in 1964 to eradicate smoking from society. Wielding medical research on the harmful effects of tobacco, he campaigned to convince America that smoking was an ""antisocial action which no self-respecting person carries on in the presence of others."" His efforts led to a ban on cigarette advertising from radio and television, which dealt a major blow to companies he once served.
Eddie felt guilty about other things, too. In the early 1950s, the United Fruit Company enlisted his help in Guatemala. The company was trying to hold onto the land leased to them by the government -land that national officials wanted to reclaim for the Guatemalan people. Bernays responded by waging a propaganda war that made president Jacobo Arbenz out to be a Communist. The claim was categorically untrue, but McCarthy-era politicos seized the rhetoric and rallied for war against the tiny nation. Bernays enlisted the CIA's help and orchestrated an elaborate liberation campaign to replace the democratically-elected president with a United Fruit Company puppet. The resulting Banana Republic lasted for decades.
Bernays must have felt his greatest moment of self-doubt in 1933 when foreign correspondent Karl von Weigand contacted him upon his return from Nazi Germany. During an interview with Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's devoted friend and minister of propaganda, von Weigand had noticed a familiar book sitting prominently on Goebbels' desk; it was Bernays' seminal work Crystallizing Public Opinion. Ironically, Eddie was Jewish.
The Sultan of Spin
Bernays formally retired in the early 1960s, but he kept working as a consultant until he was 100 years old. In 1990, he was voted to LIFE magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People of the 20th Century. Bernays died on March 9, 1995 in Cambridge, Mass. at the age of 103.
Through his long and storied career, it's estimated that Bernays had 435 clients, not to mention countless disciples. His exhaustive list of clients included General Motors, the NAACP, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and CBS, as well as famed individuals like playwright Eugene O'Neill, painter Georgia O'Keefe, and presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.
Despite his controversial campaigns, Bernays always demanded that PR professional adhere to a strict moral code. He believed the field should be licensed, like that of lawyers or doctors, so that only qualified professionals could practice. After all, he -more than anyone- understood that with the power of public persuasion came great responsibilities.
This Day in Jewish History The 'Father of Public Relations’ Dies
Edward Bernays got thousands of doctors to recommend Americans to start the day with bacon and eggs. That was just one of his stunts.
On March 9, 1995, Edward Bernays, the man widely viewed as holder of the dubious title “father of public relations” in America, died at the age of 103. Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud through both his mother and father, employed scientific methodology to achieve what he called the “engineering of consent” – persuading people through indirect means to believe in something they didn’t yet know was good for them.Want to read more?

The dispute between Philipp Lenard and Albert Einstein sheds considerable light on the power of nonscientific concerns to sway scientists. NASA via Wikimedia
Scientists are not always as scientific as many suppose. Recent well-publicized cases of scientific fraud prove that scientists can be as susceptible to the allures of wealth, power and fame as politicians, the group that enjoys the lowest public trust.
Glaring recent cases have included falsified results in the development of an HIV vaccine and new techniques for producing stem cells.
Such breaches prove that scientists do not always base their work strictly on rigorous experimentation, data collection and analysis, and hypothesis testing. In fact, scientists frequently disagree with one another, both as individuals and as representatives of competing schools of thought. Some of these debates rage on for years.
Superstring theory, sometimes called the “theory of everything,” has been a topic of vigorous contention for over 30 years.
In some cases, personalities, prejudices and petty jealousies enter the picture. Consider, for example, one of the great disputes of 20th-century physics, the long-running feud between two world-renowned physicists.
The antagonism between Philipp Lenard and Albert Einstein sheds considerable light on the power of nonscientific concerns to sway scientists.
Philipp Lenard (1862-1947) was a German experimental physicist who advanced the study of X-ray tubes, the photoelectric effect and atomic theory.
His results led him to propose (correctly) that most of the atom is composed of empty space. Lenard was a genius, operating with a deep conviction that only careful experimentation could advance the understanding of the structure of the universe. Lenard received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1905 for his work on cathode rays.
Don’t let yourself be misled. Understand issues with help from experts
Albert Einstein (1879-1955), who needs little introduction, was a Swiss theoretical physicist who developed the theories of special relativity, general relativity, mass-energy equivalence (E = mc2), and the photoelectric effect – the latter relying on key experimental results furnished by the work of Lenard.
Amazingly, Einstein made many of his seminal contributions not like Lenard, while running a laboratory at a prestigious university, but while working as a low-level Swiss patent clerk. Einstein won the Nobel prize in physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.
Initially, the relationship between Lenard and Einstein seems to have been cordial. Their correspondence suggests that each held the other in high admiration. When Einstein published his quantum theory explaining the photoelectric effect, Lenard wrote to him, “Nothing can make me happier than a thinker of great depth and scope deriving some pleasure from my work.” Einstein, in turn, referred to Lenard as “a great master and genius.”
But as detailed in a recent book, The Man Who Stalked Einstein, their relationship soon deteriorated. In a letter to a friend a few years later, Einstein expressed a quite different view of Lenard, who was then regarded by many as the most celebrated physicist in Germany:
His theories on the ether seem to me almost infantile, and some of his investigations border on the ludicrous. I am very sorry that you must waste your time with such stupidities.
Lenard, meanwhile, was soon swept along in a wave of German nationalism that accompanied World War I. He became increasingly convinced of the existence of a distinctively German physics that needed to be defended against the plagiarized or frankly fabricated work emanating from other countries. Lenard also became more and more mired in anti-Semitism, accusing the “Jewish press” of, among other things, promoting Einstein’s dangerous work on relativity.
In 1920, just a year before Einstein won the Nobel Prize, the debate between Lenard and Einstein erupted into a duel of words at a major German research conference.
Lenard argued that Einstein’s hyper-theoretical and hyper-mathematical approach to physics was exerting a pernicious influence in the field. The time had come, he argued, to restore experimentalism to its proper place. He also launched a malicious attack on Einstein, making little attempt to conceal his antipathy toward Jews.
Lenard’s attacks on Einstein became increasingly vitriolic. He compared theoretical physicists to Cubist painters, who in his view were “unable to paint decently.” He lamented the fact that a “Jewish spirit” had come to rule over physics. Of Einstein himself, whose ideas had been accepted by many of the most prominent physicists around the world, Lenard opined, “Just because a goat is born in a stable does not make him a noble thoroughbred.”
Einstein initially attempted to respond to Lenard’s attacks on his theory of relativity with humor:
“When you are courting a nice girl, an hour seems like a second, but when you sit on a red-hot cinder, a second seems like an hour. That’s relativity.”
Later, he abandoned all pretense of patience and tolerance, labeling Lenard “a really twisted fellow” who must continue “to do business with the monster until he bites the dust.”

Lenard’s conviction that science, “like everything else man produces,” was somehow grounded in bloodlines led him to become one of the early adherents of National Socialism. Unlike many German scientists who regarded Adolf Hitler with disdain, Lenard was one of his most fervent supporters, and became the regime’s number one physics authority. Ironically, the National Socialists’ disdain for “Jewish physics” was one of the main reasons they did not develop nuclear weapons.
Lenard directed his invective at other scientists. He grew extremely resentful of the credit accorded to Wilhelm Roentgen, who received the first Nobel Prize in physics for the discovery of the X-ray, despite the fact that Roentgen was German and a non-Jew. Lenard wrote that he, not Roentgen, was the “mother of the X-rays,” since he had invented the apparatus used to produce them. He likened Roentgen’s role to that of a “midwife” who merely assists with the birth.
Lenard eventually became “Chief of Aryan Physics” under the Nazi regime. In 1933 he published a book called Great Men in Science, which omitted all mention of Einstein, Roentgen and such other notable 20th-century scientists as Marie Curie. When World War II ended, Lenard’s prominent role in the Nazi regime led to his arrest, but he was quite advanced in years. Instead of being sentenced to prison, he was sent to live in a small German village, where he died at age 83.
The story of Philipp Lenard reminds us that even scientists of the very highest caliber sometimes think, speak and act in utterly unscientific ways, swayed by prejudices that have no scientific basis. They are human beings too, and members of the general public need to be careful to distinguish between a scientist whose arguments are based in evidence and one whose pronouncements stem from other, less reliable sources of conviction.
Edward Bernays was a member of this massive Jesuit machine. His uncle, Sigmund Freud, was a master Jesuit manipulator who influenced Bernays in countless ways. Freud was thought to have brought out and fully developed the narcissist in Bernays, who was known to all as a ""braggart.""
Main contributions of the Jews to the modern world (19th, 20th and 21st centuries).
It is well known that Western Civilization is based on the union of two intertwined pillars, the Greco-Latin and Judeo-Christian. In turn, the Hebrew people, People of the Book, who have bequeathed us the Bible and the Kabbalah, among other wonders, arise from the confluence of various civilizations, beginning with Sumeria (in Mesopotamia) and Egypt.
The novel approach of this museum content, undoubtedly revealing, is not to analyze the Jewish people in terms of their religious Judaism – the creator of monotheism – and enormous historical relevance (something that develops in the first seven parts of the museum), but relying on personalities of Jewish origin as individuals, men and women whose enormous contributions to the world today have served to transform our societies and our lives.
Science and humanities, philosophy, literature, cinema, art and culture, political movements, commerce and economics, business and finance, sport, journalism, media, marketing and advertising, inventions, high technology, the Internet, etc. Jews have been ubiquitous in all areas of humanity since they achieved their legal emancipation, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. To the abilities and talents of people of Jewish origin we owe a debt of gratitude.
To the abilities and talents of the Jewish we owe, among thousands of ideas and things in all areas of our daily life, the weekly day of rest – initially a Saturday or Sabbat –, –the ten commandments– including the most sacred: thou will not kill – the end of human sacrifices (Abraham and Isaac, Genesis 22), the invention of cement more than nine thousand years ago (in Jericho, the oldest city in the world), exchange papers (Chinese medieval Jews), money in bills since the XVIII century and also bearer checks, vaccines and medical advances of all kinds,
such as various treatments in the fight against cancer, hepatitis or AIDS (Gertrude B. Elion, Bruce Beutler, Ralph Marvin Steinman), the first treatment against leukemia, modern immunology (Paul Ehrlich), the first effective medicinal treatment for syphilis, the discovery of vitamins (Kazimierz Funk), cholesterol (Konrad Emil Bloch), blood groups (Karl Landsteiner), arsphenamine (Salvarsa), the structure of DNA (Rosalind Franklin), antibiotics, polio vaccines (Jonas Salk), oral contraceptive pills (Gregory Pincus), quantum physics (Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, John von Neumann), the first Big Bang Theory (Alexandre Friedmann), topology and topography (Solomon Lefschetz, Felix Hausdorff), psychology and psychoanalysis (Viena Psychoanalytic Society: Freud, Alfred Adler, Karl Abraham, Sándor Ferenczi, Wilhelm Reich, Sabina Spielrein), sociology and modern anthropology (Claude Levi-Strauss), statistics, cybernetics (Norbert Wiener), neurology and neurophysiology (Otto Loewi, Abraham Low, Rita Levi-Montalcini, Karl Pribram), the initial development of nanotechnology (Richard Feynman), plastic surgery and rhinoplasty (Irving B.

Residents seeking to surrender cats prior to July 20 should contact Animal Services by phone at 706-613-3540 for advice. 

*****

The ACCGov Animal Services Department at 125 Buddy Christian Way will not accept owner-surrendered cats for intake until Monday, July 10, 2023, due to confirmed cases of feline panleukopenia, also called pan leuk, FP, or feline parvo. Dog and stray cat intakes will continue as normal. 

Until July 10, Animal Services will limit cat intakes to stray cats only due to space constraints. Residents seeking to surrender cats prior to July 10 should contact Animal Services by phone at 706-613-3540 for advice. 

Owner reclaims of cats will continue, although owners will be advised of a potential exposure to panleukopenia and to contact their vet immediately if their cat starts to act ill. Cat adoptions will also continue in the cat adoption area. 

Two litters of kittens tested positive on June 25, 2023, for the feline panleukopenia virus. Animal Services contacted the Georgia Department of Agriculture and reported the results as required. 

Animal Shelter staff are continuing to undergo specialized cleaning processes to help minimize the spread of the virus. These steps are being taken to prevent accidental exposure to the virus for cats outside of these shelter areas through dog or human contact. 

Due to the facility's design to separate animals into different areas, the dog area of the shelter will remain open for normal operations. 

Animal Services staff has consulted with the Georgia Department of Agriculture's Animal Protection Division, which regulates and licenses animal shelters, contacted other area facilities that might be affected, and worked with Animal Services’ oversight veterinarian since the illness appeared.

Lawmakers in 11 states have either passed or introduced laws to roll back child labor laws — a push that’s come from industry trade organizations and mostly conservative legislators as businesses scramble for low-wage workers. In the past two years, those states have moved to extend working hours for children, eliminate work permit requirements, and lower the age for teens to handle alcohol or work in hazardous industries. At the same time, there has been a 69% increase in children employed illegally by companies since 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. It is “irresponsible for states to consider loosening child labor protections,” Seema Nanda, the U.S. solicitor of labor, said in a statement to States Newsroom, parent organization of the Phoenix. “Federal and state entities should be working together to increase accountability and ramp up enforcement — not make it easier to illegally hire children to do what are often dangerous jobs,” she said, adding that the Labor Department will continue to enforce longstanding federal child labor protections. This year alone, lawmakers in seven states have introduced or passed bills that would ease child labor laws. “While we’re finding out that child labor is more pervasive and more dangerous than we thought, [these] states have decided, ‘Oh, now’s a good time to weaken the child labor laws,’” said Reid Maki, the director of child labor issues and coordinator at the Child Labor Coalition. “So that’s appalling. That’s really just mind-boggling.” In the Midwest, Ohio legislators reintroduced a bill to extend working hours for teens year-round from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Minnesota lawmakers introduced a bill to roll back requirements that bar 16- and-17-year-olds from working in construction. The Iowa Legislature is considering a bill that would allow exceptions to state law prohibiting children aged 14 to 17 from working in more dangerous industries, such as roofing and mining, among other provisions that have drawn scrutiny from labor and children advocacy groups. “We got a bill that’s written by industry groups and multinational corporations that are looking for cheap labor out of our kids, and it’s really disappointing,” said Charlie Wishman, the president of the Iowa Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. But Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said there’s valuable experience to be gained as teens work in business and learn communications skills, as well as the importance of showing up for a job on time. “It, you know, teaches the kids a lot, and if they have the time to do it, and they want to earn some additional money, I don’t think we should, you know, discourage that,” she said. In the South, the Arkansas Legislature passed a law that eliminates age verification requirements for children under 16 to prove their age to get a job, and Missouri legislators introduced a bill that would extend working hours for teens 16 and older, from 7 p.m. on a school night to 10 p.m. Georgia Republicans introduced and then withdrew a bill that would eliminate work permits for minors 18 and younger, among other things. And in the Great Plains, South Dakota Republicans introduced a bill to extend working hours for children 14 and under. But lawmakers quickly withdrew it. 🪵🌽🪵Farming, logging Maki argued that child labor laws need to be strengthened, particularly relating to work in agriculture. Children as young as 12 can work on a farm because agriculture workers and domestic workers were put in a separate category in the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 that established federal child labor laws. That distinction was due to racist policymaking by Southern Democrats because during the 20th century, farmworkers were predominantly Black, Maki said. “We think it’s a legacy of racism, and you know, a lot of the kids working now in factories and in the field are brown,” he said. “And I think that’s part of the reason why the law hasn’t been fixed.” The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs estimates that there are between 400,000 to 500,000 children working on farms in the U.S. Meanwhile, there’s a bipartisan push in Congress to allow teens to work in family logging businesses. Members from states with logging interests are backing it as is the logging industry. Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, a Republican, and Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent, have introduced the “Future Logging Careers Act” that would permit 16-and-17-year olds to “work in certain mechanized logging operations under parental supervision.” In the House, it’s sponsored by Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, and Pennsylvania Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson, a Republican. “Idaho’s logging industry has long been a family trade, but current law is hampering its future by preventing young men and women from working in their family’s businesses,” Risch said in a statement. 🍽️🍽️🍽️ Teens in restaurants Jennifer Sherer, who published a report for the non-profit, left-leaning (truncated)", ,no longer populated,,2023-04-28T14:52:45.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTWZ5MWdRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--001581a8cacfb9b89b32ab76f2033e7f66ed837f/post-11370151-116524016-thumbnail,1,0,0,0,,

Over the last three months we worked diligently to pass meaningful legislation on behalf of our Georgia citizens for the betterment of our state. Below is an overview of the a few bills we passed in the final days of the session. House Action Foster Care Reform To avoid placing children in foster care unnecessarily, we passed Senate Bill 133. This bill will clarify several code sections to improve juvenile court proceedings for children who need services for child delinquency or dependency. Through this bill we are working to ensure that all avenues have been explored prior to placing a child in the system. Stipulations of the bill are as follows: Courts required to consider what state services have been provided to the child or the parent/guardian or what services may be available to allow the child to remain in their home. Courts required to attempt the secure placement of a child other than in custody of DFCS. Mandates a preliminary protective hearing take place within 72 hours of DFCS placement. Requires all parties to provide copies of medical, psychological, and educational assessments and reports of the child or the child's parent/guardian to DFCS. Public Safety Senate Bill 107, or Izzy’s Law, was also passed to lessen accidental drownings for children. This law requires the development of a model safety plan for private swim instructors to utilize by January 1, 2024. Requirements of the plan are as follows: Minimum standards for student-to-instructor ratios Secondary supervision recommendations Parent or legal guardian attendance Cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification. Violations of SB 107 would be considered a misdemeanor charge with a minimum fine of $200 for the first and second violation, as well as a $1,000 maximum fine for third and subsequent violations. To help ensure that the state’s criminal case information is accurate, up-to-date, and easily accessible to appropriate parties, we passed Senate Bill 272. This bill would reestablish the state’s Criminal Case Data Exchange Board. This board will be charged in the regular review of best tracking practices and procedures to ensure accuracy of case data. In addition, this board will work with criminal justice experts to develop a human trafficking tracking system to better stay informed of where the courts are on their proceedings regarding these crucial cases. Ensuring our criminal case data exchange is up to date will assist our overloaded court system in the streamlining process while allowing all parties involved to stay abreast of the latest happenings of their criminal case proceedings. Regulatory Reform As Georgia driving trends have shown an increased use of Electric Vehicles, we passed Senate Bill 146. This bill will provide a regulatory framework for elective vehicle (EV) charging stations and allow our state to regulate these charging stations to the same extent as gas pumps. Georgia Department of Revenue will be tasked to ensure that our state collects revenue like revenue that is typically collected from gasoline sales. Department of ‘Agriculture will have regulatory authority over EV charging stations, including inspecting these stations. Retail sale and include meters to record the total kilowatt-hours. These charging stations would also be required to provide accurate readings of electricity to their customers. Electric utilities could not provide, own, operate or maintain any publicly available charging station unless it is done through a separate legal entity. Budget News We are pleased to report that the General Assembly came to agreement on the Conference Committee Report for House Bill 19, or the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 2024) budget. Effective July 1, this final version of the FY 2024 budget is set at a revenue estimate of $32.4 billion, which is $2.2 billion, or 7.4 percent, more than the Fiscal Year 2023 budget. There are many ins and outs of the Budget and what it entails. Be on the lookout for a detailed report in the coming days covering all aspects of the 2023 Amended FY Budget and the Full 2024 FY Budget. The House of Representatives also passed the following bills and resolution from the Rules Calendar before adjourning the 2023 legislative session: ﻿ House Resolution 651, which would urge the Georgia Congressional Delegation to assist in finding reasonable solutions to protect North Atlantic right whales and Georgia's coastal culture and economy; this resolution received final passage; Senate Bill 11, or the “Georgia Fights Terrorism Act,” which would grant original jurisdiction to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for violation of laws concerning domestic, cyber, biological, chemical and nuclear terrorism; this bill received final passage; Senate Bill 13, which would update requirements for county boards of equalization, duties, review of assessments and (truncated)", ,no longer populated,,2023-04-18T15:30:06.000Z,post data removed,,0,0,0,0,,

The 2023 Session of the Georgia General Assembly is over! The gavel came down at 12:16 am Thursday to end the Session. As you know, we have a 40 day Session here in Georgia, and sometimes I say it is more like 40 days and 80 nights! The days are long as we near the end. The last day was a little over 15 hours on the Floor, plus meetings that morning that started at 8:00 am. All good, though, since we now come home to our families and jobs. I would not want the General Assembly to meet longer than 40 days. 

I have often stated to other Representatives that we should take an entire Session and work only on the budget. We could do a deep dive into each department and cancel contracts that roll over each year and may not deliver the effectiveness they once delivered. These are our tax dollars being spent. I will continue to discuss this approach with leadership. 

As for this year, one of the bills I was carrying did not make the Senate calendar in the last days, HB 264. This legislation will go back to the Senate Committee that voted it out and will be there when we start Session in 2024. 

Another bill that I carried in the House did pass. SB 103 allows citizens to contract with a third party to help recover unclaimed property that the Department of Revenue holds. Citizens can still work individually to recover their unclaimed property. Still, the process is somewhat tricky, so there is the opportunity to work with a third party to tackle this process. SB 103 passed the Senate and House and now goes to the Governor for his signature. The Governor has 40 days to review all legislation passed, starting the day after we adjourn. He can veto, sign or allow legislation to become law without his signature.

SB 233, the voucher bill, came before the House the last night for a second time. We had a 2 hour debate on Monday, and it was tabled. On Day 40, a motion was made to take it off the table, and a second motion was made for it to be sent back to the House Rules Committee so changes could be made. It came back for more discussion but failed by a vote of 85-89. Another motion to reconsider was passed, but a vote was never called. This was a very interesting bill, and after listening to the debate and talking with people at home, I voted no. We need to look seriously at our educational process and funding in the lower grades and consider revamping our teaching process to reach all the students. I did not feel like letting some students move to another school when their peers would remain in the low-performing school. This is a very complex issue, and we, as policymakers, need to work with educators to construct a plan that will work for all students, not just a few. More information must be studied to improve our school's academic delivery to all students. 

The 2023-2024 budget came to us as a conference committee report on the 40th day of the Session. A conference committee was appointed with three members of the House appointed by our Speaker and three members of the Senate appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. These six individuals meet numerous times to hammer out the differences. Once they finally agreed on the budget, the Appropriations Chairs presented the Conference Committee Report to their chamber members. We voted on the budget Wednesday, around 11:35 pm, and the vote was 170-3. I voted in favor. 

The current truck weight in Georgia is 80,000 lbs with a 4,000 lbs variance. HB 189, which passed, would make the variance 8,000 lbs. This variance applies to agricultural products only, and the law will sunset in two years. I voted for this increase.

I was happy to see several constituents come to the Capitol during the last three months. It is always great to see home folks, and I appreciate your interest in our legislative process. Your emails, texts, and calls are also very important to me, so please continue to contact me, even during the ""off-season,"" at Vance.smith@house.ga.gov or 404-656-0254.

The Georgia General Assembly returned to the State Capitol for the final two days of the 2023 legislative session on Monday, March 27. Then, on Wednesday, March 29, the session came to an end as the House and Senate completed Legislative Day 40, which is also known as “Sine Die,” a Latin term meaning “without assigning a day for further meeting.”  (My first Sine Die)

During these two eventful days, my colleagues and I worked late into the night to vote on legislation that will impact communities across our state. 

I will share some of the bills that we voted on from the
Rules calendars, as well as highlight a few House bills that received final passage this week.

Now, all of the bills that received final passage before we adjourned Sine Die will go to Governor Brian Kemp for his final consideration.

Fiscal Year 2024 Budget

Before we adjourned on Sine Die, the state legislature approved a Conference Committee Report for House Bill 19, or the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 2024) budget, fulfilling our one constitutional obligation of the session. Effective July 1, this final version of the FY 2024 budget
is set at a revenue estimate of $32.4 billion, which is $2.2 billion, or 7.4 percent, more than the Fiscal Year 2023 budget. More than 50 percent of this state budget is dedicated toward funding our state’s K-12 and higher education systems and includes $13.1 billion to fully fund the
Quality Basic Education program and an additional $50.2 million in lottery funds to bring the HOPE factor rate for scholarships and grants up to 100 percent of last year’s tuition costs. I am also excited to announce that certified teachers and school employees would experience a $2,000 increase to the state base salary schedule through this budget. Nearly a quarter of the FY 2024 budget would go toward health and human services, and within this crucial budget area, we
included $42.2 million for Medicaid reimbursement rate increases for providers. To ensure the House’s public safety priorities are reflected in this budget, this conference committee report includes $23.5 million for a total compensation increase of $4,000 for more than 3,900 law
enforcement officers across 12 state agencies; front-line state officers would receive an additional $2,000 salary adjustment in certain departments. Finally, almost 10 percent of the FY
2024 budget would go toward economic development and general government services, and seven percent of the budget would support transportation infrastructure improvements. This robust budget is full of bipartisan initiatives, and you can find more highlights from the FY 2024 budget here. HB 19 has now been sent to the governor for his consideration.

Improving Juvenile Court Proceedings/Foster Care System

During Legislative Day 39, we passed a Senate bill to help standardize the process for children who may be taken into the state’s custody. To help avoid placing children in foster care unnecessarily, Senate Bill 133 would clarify several of Georgia’s code sections to improve
juvenile court proceedings for children who are in need of services, also known as “CHINS,” or for child delinquency or dependency proceedings. Under this bill, prior to placing a child in the
custody of the Georgia Division of Family & Children Services (DFCS), the court would first consider what state services have been provided to the child or the parent/guardian or what services may be available to allow the child to remain in their home. A judge would also
consider what efforts have been made to secure the placement of a child other than in custody of DFCS or if a child protective services report was made. After a child is ordered into the custody
of DFCS, the bill would mandate that a preliminary protective hearing take place within 72 hours of the placement and require all parties to provide copies of medical, psychological and educational assessments and reports of the child or the child's parent/guardian to DFCS, which
would give the state more time to act quickly to find a place for a child in need of an alternate living situation. In recent years, the state has struggled to find housing and foster families for children with complex needs, which has resulted in these children staying in hotels and other
temporary spaces. If Gov. Kemp signs this bill into law, DFCS and our court systems could do a better job ensuring that children receive appropriate care, have placement options identified in a
timely manner and, hopefully, provide services that could avoid placing them into foster care altogether.

Water Safety Plans for Swimming Lessons

We also unanimously passed a measure that aims to prevent drowning accidents during swim lessons. Senate Bill 107, or Izzy’s Law, would require the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) to develop a model safety plan for private swim instructors to utilize by January 1,
2024. This safety plan would include minimum standards for student-to-instructor ratios, secondary supervision recommendations, parent or legal guardian attendance, as well as the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification. Private swim instructors would be required to use DPH's model aquatic safety plan or have their own water safety plan in place by April 1, 2024. Violations of SB 107 would be considered a misdemeanor charge with a minimum fine of $200
for the first and second violation, as well as a $1,000 maximum fine for third and subsequent violations. This legislation is named after Izzy Scott, a four year old boy who drowned on his second day of swimming lessons at a private pool in Georgia. Following the tragic death of this young boy, Izzy’s family found that our state laws lacked safety standards for these private swim instructors, which initially prevented prosecutors from bringing charges against the instructor.
We were honored to have Izzy’s family join us in the House gallery this week to watch the passage of this important legislation. If SB 107 is signed into law, Izzy’s Law would ensure that swim instructors have a plan in place to help prevent future drowning accidents from happening to the children entrusted to their care. This bill received final passage before the session adjourned.

Building Georgia’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

The House also overwhelmingly passed Senate Bill 146 to provide a regulatory framework for elective vehicle (EV) charging stations and allow our state to regulate these charging stations to the same extent as gas pumps. SB 146 would provide that the sale of electricity at EV charging stations would be similar to the sale of gasoline, and this Senate measure would establish an excise tax set by the Georgia Department of Revenue to ensure that our state collects revenue similar to revenue that is typically collected from gasoline sales. The
bill would give the Georgia Department of Agriculture regulatory authority over EV charging stations, including inspecting these stations. All EV charging stations would be required to
charge vehicles on a per kilowatt-hour basis as a retail sale and include meters to record the total kilowatt-hours. These charging stations would also be required to provide accurate readings of
electricity to their customers. Furthermore, electric utilities could not provide, own, operate or maintain any publicly available charging station unless it is done through a separate legal entity.
As the EV market continues to grow in Georgia, its infrastructure must be able to efficiently and fairly support EV drivers, and SB 146 would lay the necessary groundwork for this developing industry. This bill received final passage this week and has been sent to Gov. Kemp for his consideration.

Reestablishing the Criminal Case Data Exchange Board

On Legislative Day 40, we passed legislation to help to dedicate state resources toward making sure that the state’s criminal case information is accurate, up-to-date and easily accessible to the appropriate parties. Senate Bill 272 would reestablish the state’s Criminal Case Data Exchange Board, which previously operated under the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council and later within an organization under the Council of Superior Court Clerks, to now
operate within a board under the Judicial Council and its Administrative Office of the Courts. The board would help review the state's criminal case data exchange and management systems;
make recommendations to improve data sharing with the public, employers and law enforcement; provide regular advice and counsel to the Judicial Council of Georgia; and update uniform standards. The Criminal Case Data Exchange Board would also report its progress and
findings to the General Assembly annually. By December 2024, the board would conduct a feasibility study with criminal justice experts to develop a system for tracking and analyzing criminal history data regarding recidivism, criminal plea agreements and immunity defenses, and this board would also study a system to track human trafficking charges and whether those charges resulted in convictions or pleas of lesser or related charges; the board would share these
results with the legislative, judicial and executive branches. The reestablishment of the Criminal Case Data Exchange Board would help improve the accuracy and accessibility of critical case information and provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the state's criminal justice system, helping to inform data-driven decisions related to criminal justice policy and practice. The Senate agreed to the House’s updated version of SB 272, which means this bill is also on its
way to the governor’s desk.

2023 Study Committees

Each session, the House establishes study committees that work throughout the summer and fall to examine specific policy issues and/or topics that are important to Georgians. Before the session ended, the House adopted several measures to create new study committees that will certainly keep us busy until the 2024 legislative session. On Monday, my colleagues and I adopted House Resolution 488 to reauthorize the House Rural Development Council (HRDC) for
the next two years. Created by the late Speaker David Ralston in 2017, the HRDC will continue to work with rural communities to find ways to encourage economic growth and job creation and develop effective legislative solutions targeted toward supporting these communities. We also approved Senate Resolution 175 to create two study committees this interim, including the Joint Study Committee on Dual Enrollment for Highly Skilled Talent at Younger Ages. This education-focused study committee will examine existing and potential dual enrollment opportunities to develop highly skilled talent at younger ages. SB 175 also establishes the Joint Study Committee on Service Delivery Strategy (SDS), and this group will explore how to assist
local governments as they create SDS plans for their communities. The House adopted House Resolution 603 to create the House Study Committee on Certificate of Need (CON) Modernization, which will address how our 40-year-old CON laws can be improved to meet
today’s health care needs. Finally, House Resolution 519 was also adopted to create the House Study Committee on Fishing Access to Freshwater Resources, and this group will examine recent issues that have hindered public access to our rivers and other waterways. In the coming weeks, Speaker Jon Burns (R-Newington) will appoint various House members on both sides of the aisle to serve on these legislative study committees. 

Final Passage of House Bills

My colleagues and I also gave final passage to a flurry of House bills on Legislative Day 40, and I would like to make you aware of just a few of these bills that are on their way to the governor’s desk. House Bill 88, or the Coleman-Baker Act, would require law enforcement
agencies to conduct a thorough review of an original cold case murder investigation dating back to 1970 upon written request to determine if a new investigation could produce new leads or identify a likely perpetrator. This bill also sets guidelines for how agencies should process requests for these reviews and how to handle any full reinvestigations. Additionally, the University of Georgia’s Carl Vinson Institute of Government would create a tracking system and
public website about these applications and investigations. HB 88 would also allow a coroner or medical examiner to issue a death certificate with a non-specific cause of death. House Bill 120
would update the list of individuals with a suspended, revoked or canceled license who are eligible to apply for a limited driving permit by including individuals convicted of driving under the influence of a controlled substance or marijuana and those in non-compliance with a child support order. House Bill 163 would establish a student loan repayment program for full-time medical examiners employed with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s Division of Forensic Sciences; these medical examiners would be eligible for up to $120,000 in student debt repayment, which would be repaid in annual installments over five years. House Bill 188, or Mariam’s Law, would implement several changes related to sexual offenses in Georgia. This bill
would change the name of the Sexual Offender Registration Review Board to the Sexual Offender Risk Review Board (SORRB), add definitions of certain sexual felonies and add punishments for such crimes; this bill would also create harsher penalties for individuals
previously convicted of sexual felonies who are convicted again, and electronic monitoring would be required as a condition of probation for such individuals. The bill would also improve how the state handles sexual offenders who move to Georgia and clarify SORRB’s risk
assessment evaluation process/timelines for sexually dangerous predators. House Bill 414 would create the Veterans Mental Health Services Program, a grant program that would fund behavioral
health services to service members, veterans or family members through non-profit community behavioral health programs; the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental
Disabilities would administer this competitive grant program. House Bill 538, or the Georgia Early Literacy Act, would require schools systems to teach high-quality literacy instructional materials approved by the State Board of Education in grades kindergarten through third grade based on the science of reading. The Georgia Department of Education would develop and provide training to these teachers, and teachers who are licensed or commissioned by the state to teach literacy instruction would be required to receive training by July 2025. Students across the state would also take a universal reading screener assessment to monitor their progress in foundational literacy skills multiple times a year. 

The ""Truck Weight Bill"" - The General Assembly also adopted a Conference Committee Report on House Bill 189 to provide a 10 percent weight variance for trucks when hauling agricultural or farm products within a 250 mile radius of the farm or point of origin outside of the 13 county metro Atlanta region. (Douglas and Paulding Counties are in this 13 county metro region-that means the trucks are going around our counties- not through them); this variance would increase the truck limit weight from 80,000 pounds to 88,000 pounds on Georgia roads. 

While a number of House bills did not receive final passage before we adjourned, the General Assembly will have a chance to take up these House bills again during the 2024 legislative session. I will provide a more comprehensive review of bills that received final passage in the coming weeks, as well as an
update about which of those bills are signed into law.

Signing Bills into Law

Although the 2023 legislative session has officially come to an end, I look forward to sharing more updates about different bills that made it across the finish line this session and are on their way to becoming official laws. Over the next 40 days, Gov. Kemp will sign or veto
measures that received final passage by the House and Senate this session. Any bill the governor signs will become law, and any legislation not signed or vetoed within this 40-day period will
also automatically become law. House bills that did not receive final passage this session have been sent back to their respective committees, and these bills will be eligible for consideration
again next year. 

I hope that you will contact me if you have any questions regarding potential new state laws or if you have any suggestions for future legislation.

StanGunterBanter.JPG 2023 Legislative Update Last week brought the conclusion of our eleventh week under the Gold Dome. As we have completed 38 of 40 legislative days, we are working tirelessly to pass our legislation prior to our Sine Die deadline. It is important to remember that any legislation not reaching passage this session, will remain active and be up for debate next year. Our last few days under the Gold Dome have been busy as we passed numerous bills out of the House chamber. House Action Healthcare Last week we continued our ongoing efforts to support women with high-risk pregnancies through Senate Bill 106. Also known as the “Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Act,” this bill would create a Medicaid program to provide telemedicine clinical services to women with high-risk pregnancies. While we currently provide in home check-ins to those in need of maternal care, we are hopeful that virtual in-home check-ins could further improve maternal health outcomes for our high-risk pregnant women living in rural or underserved areas. In previous years, we have worked to address the ongoing issue of “Surprise Billing” within the healthcare industry. We updated current law through the passage of Senate Bill 20, the “Consumer Access to Contracted Healthcare (CATCH) Act.” Stipulations of the bill are as follows: Requires that insurers contract with and maintain a sufficient number of participating network providers, including primary and specialty care, pharmacies, clinical laboratories and facilities Prohibits insurers from denying preauthorization of services rendered by an in-network provider just because the referring provider is out-of-network. Grants the Insurance Commissioner the authority to review network adequacy to ensure the benefits are delivered as promised through reasonable access to enough in-network primary and specialty care and all other health care services included under the terms of the contract. Public Safety Sadly, our state has served as a hub for sex trafficking in recent years. Last week we strengthened laws to fight against this vile form of modern-day slavery through the passage of Senate Bill 42. This bill would revise the penalty for certain businesses that fail to post required signage about the human trafficking hotline. Under this bill, a business would have 30 days to post the appropriate signage if a law enforcement officer notifies the business of its noncompliance. Fines for violation as are follows: Increases maximum fine to between $500 and $1,000. Increases fines for repeat offenders ranging between $1,000 and $5,000. We must all work together in order to “END IT.” We are hopeful that increased penalties will encourage businesses to post signs to assist our law enforcement officers working around the clock on behalf of sex trafficking victims. Last week also brought bipartisan support of Senate Bill 218 which would allow state identification cards to be issued to inmates after they have completed a term of incarceration. In addition to the state issued ID, inmates are also allowed to request documentation regarding programs and degrees earned during incarceration. We are hopeful that this measure will assist those wishing to reenter the workforce with more ease. To ensure our state government is further protected against foreign cyber-attack threats, we took action through the unanimous passage of Senate Bill 93. This bill will prohibit the use of certain foreign-owned social media platforms on state-owned devices. The prohibition would also stand when a foreign adversary has substantial control over the content moderation practices of the platform or if the platform uses software or an algorithm that is controlled or monitored by a foreign adversary. In December of 2022, Governor Kemp issued an order to ban TIK TOK from state owned devices and this bill simply makes that order official law. Education More students will have greater access to our HOPE grant program though the passage of Senate Bill 86. This bill will expand access to the HOPE grant program to high school students participating in our dual enrollment programs. We feel confident that this action will encourage more high school students to take advantage of our dual enrollment programs, allowing them to pursue their career paths earlier in their educational journey with this grant assistance. Expansion of this program includes the following: Expands access to HOPE grant program to high school students who are preparing to join the workforce by earning college credit before graduation. Allows eligible dual enrollment students to access HOPE grant funds for eligible career, technical and agricultural education (CTAE) courses.

Senate Bill 86 to expand access to the HOPE grant program to high school students who are already preparing themselves to join our state’s workforce by earning college credit before graduation. SB 86 would allow eligible dual enrollment students to access HOPE grant funds for eligible career, technical and agricultural education (CTAE) courses, regardless of whether a student has reached the maximum credit hour cap to receive these funds.

Senate Bill 61 to permanently allow Georgia’s private sector workers to continue to utilize their paid sick leave to care for a family member in need. This legislation would remove the end date of the current provision under the Family Care Act that requires employers to allow employees to use up to five days per calendar year of earned sick leave for the care of an immediate family member who is ill. The current law was set to expire this July, and SB 61 would ensure that eligible Georgians can continue to take their earned time off to take care of their sick family members.

Senate Bill 106, or the “Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Act,” would create a Medicaid program to provide virtual maternal health clinical services to women with high-risk pregnancies through the Georgia Department of Public Health’s (DPH) pilot home visiting program.
Senate Bill 218 would allow state identification cards to be issued to inmates after they have completed a term of incarceration. The Georgia Department of Corrections (DOC) and the Georgia Department of Driver Services would work together to process these ID cards, which would look like any other state-issued ID and would not include any stigmatizing information about their status as a past offender.

On Monday, March 20, the Georgia House of Representatives reconvened under the Gold Dome for our last full week of the 2023 legislative session. The end of session is quickly approaching, and we will reach Legislative Day 40, also known as “Sine Die,” on March 29.

While some might assume that our official business is winding down in these final days, we have actually ramped up our House efforts to perfect and pass legislation before the legislative session
comes to an end next week.

I am excited to announce that the Georgia House of Representatives passed legislation this week to help support women with high-risk pregnancies, particularly in underserved
communities, in an effort to address infant and maternal mortality. Senate Bill 106, or the “Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Act,” would create a Medicaid program to provide virtual maternal health clinical services to women with high-risk pregnancies through the Georgia Department of Public Health’s (DPH) pilot home visiting program. Georgia currently has evidence-based home visiting programs that provide family-centric support services to at-risk
pregnant women and families with children up to five years of age, but SB 106 would offer these services virtually to Medicaid recipients. These at-home interventions can reduce the risk of
preterm birth and improve the management of various risks during pregnancies, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension and depression. By allowing virtual check-ins, we could
improve maternal health outcomes in our state in several ways and make it easier for the program’s workers to reach high-risk pregnant women living in rural or underserved areas.

We gave unanimous final passage to Senate legislation this week to ensure that Georgia businesses do their part to help spread awareness and stop human trafficking in Georgia. Senate
Bill 42 would revise the penalty for certain businesses that fail to post required signage about the human trafficking hotline, which handles tips about potential sex and labor trafficking and reports such incidents to law enforcement. Under this bill, a business would have 30 days to post the appropriate signage if a law enforcement officer notifies the business of its noncompliance. The fine for this violation currently has a maximum of $500, and this bill would increase the fine to between $500 and $1,000. For multiple violations, the fine would also increase and range
between $1,000 and $5,000. Currently, these fines are discretionary, meaning they are not always enforced, and this bill would guarantee that these businesses comply with this crucial law.
Recognizing and reporting potentially dangerous situations are the first steps to ending human trafficking in our state. To report suspected human trafficking in Georgia, you can call the
statewide 24-hour hotline at (866) 363-4842.

This week, we passed a bipartisan Senate measure to support Georgians as they rebuild their lives after prison. Senate Bill 218 would allow state identification cards to be issued to
inmates after they have completed a term of incarceration. The Georgia Department of Corrections (DOC) and the Georgia Department of Driver Services would work together to
process these ID cards, which would look like any other state-issued ID and would not include any stigmatizing information about their status as a past offender. Additionally, when an inmate
is released from a DOC facility, the individual could request documentation regarding programs he or she completed at the request of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles or the DOC.
These individuals could also request documentation if they have obtained a state-approved high school equivalency diploma, other educational degrees and their institutional work record,
including skills obtained through job training. Providing this necessary documentation and identification through this legislation would enable these Georgians to gain employment and start
to rebuild their lives after incarceration.

The House also unanimously passed Senate Bill 93 to prohibit the use of certain foreign- owned social media platforms on state-owned devices. This ban would only apply to social media platforms that are owned or operated by a foreign adversary or by a company which is domiciled in, has its headquarters in or is organized under the laws of a foreign adversary. The prohibition would also stand when a foreign adversary has substantial control over the content moderation practices of the platform or if the platform uses software or an algorithm that is controlled or monitored by a foreign adversary. Gov. Kemp previously issued a memo to state agencies in December to prohibit employees from using TikTok on their state-owned devices, such as cellphones or laptops, and this legislation would make his ban an official law. Gov. Kemp and other proponents of this legislation aim to prevent TikTok from accessing critical, private information or collecting data about our state government’s operations.

My colleagues and I also approved legislation on the House floor that would amend Georgia’s “Surprise Billing Consumer Protection Act,” which was a House-led initiative in 2020
aimed at increasing affordable, quality health care options for Georgians. Senate Bill 20, or the“Consumer Access to Contracted Healthcare (CATCH) Act,” would update this law to require
insurers to contract with and maintain a sufficient and appropriate number of participating network providers, including primary and specialty care, pharmacies, clinical laboratories and facilities. Furthermore, if a network plan offers coverage for mental health or substance use disorders, the insurance company would also need to maintain contracts with a range of providers that specialize in mental health or substance abuse services. Additionally, insurers
would be prohibited from denying preauthorization of services rendered by an in-network provider just because the referring provider is out-of-network. The bill would also give the
state’s insurance commissioner the authority to review network adequacy, which is a health plans ability to deliver the benefits promised through reasonable access to enough in-network
primary and specialty care and all other health care services included under the terms of the contract. This legislation builds upon our work to provide Georgians with access to quality
health care by setting better network adequacy standards so that our citizens get the most out of their health insurance plans.

On Thursday, the House passed Senate Bill 86 to expand access to the HOPE grant program to high school students who are already preparing themselves to join our state’s workforce by earning college credit before graduation. SB 86 would allow eligible dual enrollment students to access HOPE grant funds for eligible career, technical and agricultural education (CTAE) courses, regardless of whether a student has reached the maximum credit hour
cap to receive these funds. To ensure this grant funding is put to good use, the Georgia Student Finance Commission would collaborate with the Technical College System of Georgia to collect
and report certain data related to the dual enrollment program to track the program’s impact. Local CTAE courses are crucial to supporting high-demand career fields throughout our state, and these funds would help students pay for the necessary technical training to launch their careers and contribute to our state’s workforce.

We passed Senate Bill 26, or the Georgia Electric Vehicle Future Act, to advance the electric vehicle (EV) industry in the state. This legislation would authorize the Georgia Department of Economic Development to establish and support a statewide electric vehicle
manufacturing program, which would focus its efforts on developing, marketing and promoting investments and job creation for Georgia’s EV industry. Our state’s economic development arm would also work with our state’s transportation department and technology and tollway authorities to build out the appropriate infrastructure, such as EV charging stations, to support this growing industry. Additionally, this legislation would establish the Georgia Electric Vehicle Manufacturing Commission. Comprised of private sector and public officials, this commission would serve as an oversight body for our state-led EV initiatives, work to develop policy recommendations for the General Assembly to consider, as well as coordinate with our higher educational systems to determine our workforce needs and help train future workers for this industry. The Georgia Electric Vehicle Future Act would promote public-private partnerships to develop forward-looking EV solutions, support this job-producing industry and strengthen Georgia’s position in EV manufacturing and innovation. 

We also gave final passage to Senate Bill 61 to permanently allow Georgia’s private sector workers to continue to utilize their paid sick leave to care for a family member in need. This legislation would remove the end date of the current provision under the Family Care Act that requires employers to allow employees to use up to five days per calendar year of earned sick leave for the care of an immediate family member who is ill. The current law was set to expire this July, and SB 61 would ensure that eligible Georgians can continue to take their earned time off to take care of their sick family members.

Next week, the Georgia General Assembly will convene for two legislative days before the 2023 legislative session adjourns “Sine Die” on Wednesday, March 29. My House colleagues
and I will be hard at work during these final two legislative days to pass meaningful legislation, for our state and its citizens, which will surely be our busiest and longest days of the entire session.

Before we complete our legislative business for the session, I urge you to contact me if you have any questions, concerns or input on any measures being considered in the House or Senate. I can be reached at my Capitol office at 404-656-0325 or at Kimberly.New@house.ga.gov

Cheokas Votes for Budget That Invests in Rural Georgia 
Rep. Mike Cheokas (R-Americus) this week voted for and advocated strongly to pass the 2024 state budget that will provide pay increases to teachers and law 
enforcement as well as make significant investments in agriculture, rural healthcare services, and higher education in Southwest Georgia.
 
“Our district will benefit greatly from the investments seen in this budget, which will bring pay raises to recruit and retain the public servants who teach our children and those who keep us safe,” said Cheokas. “We have fully funded our public schools and we have made sure that children from low-income families have access to the nutrition they need at school. Additionally, this budget provides for a $5 million investment into Georgia SouthWestern State University through a bond package.”

Cheokas said the budget includes many items especially important to rural areas of the state.
 
“We are bolstering the Department of Agriculture and the Georgia Forestry Service with pay raises, adding veterinary labs in North and South Georgia and we are creating incentives for healthcare providers to come to and stay in rural communities with loan repayment programs and additional funding.”
 
Other budget highlights include:
• $13.1 Billion to fully fund Georgia’s K-12 education system
• $2.7 million to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for the   creation of cold case specialty unit
• $8.1 million to fund new 375 waiver slots for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities   
• $1.6 million to support the behavioral health needs of children across the state", ,no longer populated,,2023-03-14T17:56:53.000Z,post data removed,,13,0,2,0,,

Next, Sen. Ossoff met with students and leaders at Fort Valley State University to announce $4 million he secured with Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock & Congressman David Scott for a new partnership between FVSU & the University of Georgia to help train the next generation of Georgia’s poultry farmers and scientists. Sen. Ossoff later joined Congressman Sanford Bishop, Georgia Department of Education leaders, USDA, and local leaders in Albany to announce a new partnership between the USDA and the State of Georgia to purchase locally grown, fresh foods for kids in school. In Ochlocknee, Sen. Ossoff met with citrus growers — one of Georgia's fastest growing industries. They discussed key industry needs — including expanding facilities to keep up with demand & strengthening research on diseases & pests that pose a threat their crop. Later in the afternoon, Sen.

She’s been around the Capital since the 90’s and is very well respected. I have enjoyed getting to know her and learning from her over the past few weeks as well as numerous other South Georgia legislators. We are very well represented in Atlanta. 

Was happy to host several County Commissioners this week as part of ACCG’s Day at the Capital. I appreciate their visit. It is always good to build upon relationships between local and state governments. 

We were able to visit with Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry to discuss some important transportation issues in District 172. Look forward to working with them in the future. 

Finally, I want to thank my fellow House members and our own Sam Watson for State Senate for congratulating me on my first bill, which would establish an Agricultural Commodity Commission for the growing Citrus Industry in Georgia. 

Only a few more weeks left in Session and I look forward to finishing up strong as we get closer to Sine Die. It is a pleasure to represent District 172.", ,no longer populated,,2023-03-11T12:15:37.000Z,post data removed,,56,1,4,0,,

China balloon, USA shoot down, relations and a phone call rejected: 'Your request has been denied' - that's the message from China who rejected to take a call from the US defence minister, after Washington shot down what Beijing has called a weather balloon. Victor Gao reports and it seems (rightly) that China is ticked off. The U.S. Defence Department submitted a request for a call between Lloyd Austin and China’s Minister of National Defence Wei Fenghe immediately after the US fighter jets shot down the balloon on Saturday afternoon but China declined the request, according to the Pentagon.

A) --- Russia warns of direct clash with US
Washington is seeking a deterrence advantage over Russia, which could cause an outright war, Moscow has warned
The US has “unleashed a total hybrid war” against Russia and is putting the two nuclear nations on a path to direct confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said. It claims Washington’s demands for nuclear inspections in Russia are “cynical”, considering its “obvious” assistance in Ukrainian attacks against Russian strategic nuclear forces.
The allegations were part of the Ministry’s public comments on the status of the New START treaty, the last remaining US-Russian agreement on nuclear weapons reduction. According to US media, the Department of State notified the Congress last week that Russia was in “noncompliance” due to a refusal to facilitate inspections on its soil.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that was not true, since the treaty allows suspension of inspection. Washington was the first to start barring Russian monitors from doing their job in the US, it alleged. The ministry said that “created obvious unilateral benefits” for the US and prompted a response in kind by Moscow.
The 2010 treaty was signed in a different environment and is based on the notion that the US and Russia are equal partners who seek to build trust and improve global security through disarmament, as reflected in its text, the ministry explained. But now that Washington has declared the “strategic defeat” of Russia as its goal and ramped up tensions in all aspects of bilateral relations, there can be no “business as usual” with the US, according to the statement.
""Until Washington revises its hostile stance regarding Russia and drops the policy of increasing the threats towards our national security,” Moscow will consider any proposed gestures of goodwill under the nuclear treaty “unjustified, untimely and uncalled for.”
The Russian ministry didn’t elaborate on which “strategic nuclear forces objects” the Ukrainian side attacked with US help, which allegedly involved “military-technical and information-intelligence” aspects.
The Russian Defense Ministry has previously blamed Ukraine for two attacks against Engels air base in Saratov Region. Both happened in December and reportedly involved Soviet-made long-range drones. The first incident coincided with a similar attack against the Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Region.
Both Russian airfields host strategic bomber planes, which can carry and deploy nuclear weapons in addition to conventional air-launched missiles.https://www.rt.com/russia/571172-nuclear-treaty-breach-russia/============================================8 Feb, 2023 08:47
B) --- Moscow assesses prospects for peace with Kiev
Russia’s UN envoy Vassily Nebenzia has called on the West to stop using Ukrainians in a “proxy war”
The West is only prolonging the bloodshed in Ukraine by supplying Kiev with weapons and waging a proxy war against Moscow, Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, said on Tuesday. The statement came the same day US President Joe Biden vowed to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes.”
“The prospects of peace will be closer when the flooding of Ukraine with weapons stops… and when they realistically listen to our concerns,” Nebenzia told reporters at a press conference. He urged Ukraine’s Western backers to stop “using Ukrainians to wage a proxy war against us.”
Asked by a reporter if a peaceful resolution to the conflict could happen in 2023, the diplomat replied: “We all hope for peace.”
Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine nearly a year ago, citing the need to protect the people of Donbass and Kiev’s failure to implement the 2014-2015 Minsk peace accords. Many Western countries and NATO members have since supplied Ukraine with heavy weapons, including anti-armor systems, multiple rocket launchers, howitzers and combat drones. Last month, the US, Britain and Germany pledged for the first time to deliver tanks.
In his annual address to Congress on Tuesday, President Biden described Russia’s military operation in Ukraine as “a test for the ages” and threat to “our security and prosperity.”
“Together, we did what America always does at our best. We led. We united NATO and built a global coalition… We stood with the Ukrainian people,” Biden said.
Russia, meanwhile, maintains that foreign arms will not change the course of the conflict and only lead to further escalation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in December that the US and NATO were “directly involved” by providing weapons and training to Ukrainian troops.
Ukrainian officials insist that peace can only be achieved if Russia agrees to surrender its newly incorporated territories. Moscow has rejected these terms as unacceptable.
The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, together with two other former Ukrainian territories – the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions – became parts of Russia after holding referendums on the matter in September.

C) --- Moscow says it’s ready for ‘normal talks’ with West
There’s no point, however, in reading “statements that have already been voiced in public,” a senior Russian diplomat believes
Moscow is ready for a substantive discussion with the collective West as a whole or any party, Sergey Belyaev, the director of the Second European Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, has said. The senior diplomat made the remarks in an interview with RTVI published Tuesday.
Russia is prepared to talk to “anyone, with the British and, in general, with the Finns, Swedes, anyone,” Belyaev stressed. “If there is a desire to sit down and have a normal talk about ways to normalize the situation, about ways to minimize risks – and there are risks.”
At the same time, there’s no point in any negotiations if the “conversation with us is needed only in order to sit down at the table and read to us, as it sometimes happens, those statements that have already been voiced in public,” he added.
The diplomat pointed to the inability of Western nations to negotiate in any meaningful way, recalling the aftermath of the blasts that heavily damaged the Nord Stream pipelines last September. Despite Moscow’s repeated calls for a joint probe into the incident, the West has exhibited a very suspicious reluctance to perform a transparent investigation, Belyaev noted.
“To all our proposals [on the potential probe] there was either no answer, or the answer was a categorical ‘no.’ The question arises: if they do not want to conduct an investigation together with us, then why?” he wondered.
Relations between Russia and the West had been fraught for some time but entered a downward spiral last February after Moscow launched its military operation in neighboring Ukraine, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, which were designed to give Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian, German, and French leaders have since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the agreement to buy time for Kiev to build up its military.
The operation was preceded by Moscow having called for a comprehensive, multiparty security guarantees agreement, but this was squarely rejected by Washington.https://www.rt.com/russia/571136-moscow-west-normal-talk/=============================================8 Feb, 2023 13:03
N1) --- 10,000+ killed in Türkiye-Syria earthquakes
Rescuers in both countries continue to clear the rubble and look for survivors 48 hours after the disaster
The death toll from the catastrophic earthquakes in southern Türkiye and northwestern Syria has now moved past 10,000, officials said on Wednesday.
Rescuers, meanwhile, continue to clear the rubble and look for survivors. Teams from dozens of countries are helping locals in both states.
In Türkiye, over 8,500 people were killed and nearly 50,000 injured, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters after arriving in Kahramanmaras, a city in the province where the epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude quake was recorded.
According to Erdogan, nearly 6,500 buildings were destroyed. Vice President Fuat Oktay said earlier that more than 450,000 residents who had lost their homes were being housed in student dormitories.
People are still being found alive under the rubble. Anadolu news agency reported that two women were rescued after spending 48 hours trapped in the debris of a destroyed apartment block in Hatay Province.
On Monday morning, a series of powerful earthquakes ravaged the southern part of the country, leveling houses in several cities. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described it as “the biggest disaster” since the 1939 Erzincan earthquake.
A three-month state of emergency was declared in the ten affected provinces on Tuesday. All schools across the country were closed for a week.
In neighboring Syria, more than 1,260 were killed and nearly 2,300 injured, Health Minister Hassan al-Ghabbash said. Separately, over 1,400 dead and around 2,700 injured were reported in the northwestern parts of Syria not controlled by the government, according to the Washington Post.
Al Ghabbash said officials were working “around the clock” to maintain the flow of medical and other supplies to Aleppo, Latakia and Hama, the regions hit hardest by the quake. More than 70 mosques have been equipped to function as shelters, according to the government.see https://rumble.com/v28qs92-children-pulled-out-of-rubble-hours-after-horrific-quakes-in-trkiye.html?mref=6zof&mrefc=3-https://www.rt.com/news/571168-turkiye-syria-earthquakes-casualties/============================================

1) --- Exiled opposition leader accuses Western-backed forces of using neo-Nazis in Ukraine
The US and EU have a vested interest in the country, no matter how radical the government becomes, Viktor Medvedchuk said
Radical political forces are a weapon routinely used by Western-backed actors in Ukraine to stifle opponents, exiled opposition leader Viktor Medvedchuk believes. The US and its allies are willing to overlook this as long as it serves their interests, he said.
“Neo-Nazism is the cudgel that pro-Western forces turn to when they lose. Then, the mask of democracy and peacemaking comes off instantly, and opponents find themselves back in the harsh reality of political cannibalism,” the Ukrainian politician wrote in an analysis of the ongoing conflict, which was published on Wednesday by RIA Novosti.
Medvedchuk’s Opposition Platform – For Life party was the largest opposition faction in the Ukrainian parliament before a government crack down led by President Vladimir Zelensky banned the bloc for supposedly being pro-Russian.
The party was targeted because it had every chance to topple Zelensky at the ballot box, he said, citing opinion polls, but a “system of oppression” was deployed against it.
Historically, in Ukraine “as soon as a non pro-Western force gains ground, scores higher approval, pro-Western forces do everything to ban it,” he wrote. Radicals in the media “slander opposition politicians, threaten their supporters and urge a mass crackdown.”
Today, any speech in the pro-Western media is hailed as freedom of expression, whereas outlets allowing dissent are “declared propagandists, and its journalists branded traitors” and blacklisted.
The West never sees this as incitement, as a call for violence and lawlessness, as it never sees the ensuing violence and lawlessness.
Meanwhile, thugs who are used to suppress the opposition act with impunity in Ukraine, even maiming and killing their targets, Medvedchuk asserted. Any attempt to defend oneself is treated as “aggression and separatism.”
“Today, Ukraine is in the hands of people, who don’t speak Ukrainian [as their mother tongue] and who are mostly not ethnic Ukrainians,” the politician stated. “They turned the Ukrainian language into a ‘friend-or-foe’ designator to cover up their true intentions.”
READ MORE: Zelensky ‘set fire’ to Ukraine – exiled opposition leaderThe Ukrainian case stands out because of the resources that the US and its allies have invested into tearing the country away from Russia and showcasing it as an example of pro-Western development, Medvedchuk believes.
If Kiev fails, the “political bankruptcy” of Washington’s global leadership would be exposed, as will the failure of EU expansion, which the politician compared to the construction of the Tower of Babel in terms of the chaos it produces.https://www.rt.com/russia/571158-medvedchuk-west-neonazis-opposition/============================================

2) --- German defense minister admits Ukraine doubts
Boris Pistorius said it was “difficult” to determine if Kiev could retake Crimea and Donbass
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has expressed uncertainty over Ukraine’s ability to achieve its goal of retaking Crimea and Donbass. The official claimed that the West’s continued support for Kiev would be key in determining the outcome of the conflict with Russia.
Speaking to Germany’s Bild newspaper on Tuesday during an official visit to the Ukrainian capital, Pistorius was asked if Kiev would manage to restore control over all the territories within its 1991 borders.
The minister described the question as “difficult” and likened it to a “look into the crystal ball.” While stopping short of a prediction, Pistorius commended the bravery of Kiev’s forces, adding that “it is vital that we continue to support Ukraine to the best of our ability.”
“This is an intense war of attrition. There are insanely high losses,” the German official said.
When asked if he stood by his previous maxim that “Ukraine must win the war,” Pistorius replied: “Yes, of course.”
According to the German minister, much like Ukraine’s ability to make territorial gains, the prospect of peace negotiations remains uncertain.
Pistorius, who took office on January 19, confirmed Berlin’s commitment to providing Kiev with 14 Leopard 2A6 main battle tanks by late March, with the training of Ukrainian personnel expected to start in the near future.
Pistorius stressed that he sees the delivery of air defense systems in the coming months as crucial, while calling into question the potential usefulness of submarines, should Kiev request them further down the line.
Responding to Western nations’ plans to supply Ukraine with tanks and other heavy weapons, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu warned on Tuesday that “such moves are essentially dragging NATO countries into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable escalation.”
However, he expressed confidence that the Russian military would destroy the hardware.
Top Russian officials have consistently argued that Western arms deliveries only serve to prolong the conflict unnecessarily.https://www.rt.com/news/571155-german-defense-minister-ukraine-crimea-donbass/=============================================

3) --- Сhechen leader predicts end of Ukraine conflict
The hostilities will subside by the end of the year, Ramzan Kadyrov has said
The Russian military operation against Ukraine will be wrapped up by the end of the year, according to the head of Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. He also predicted that the West would be forced to admit its mistakes regarding relations with Moscow.
“European nations will acknowledge that their actions were wrong. The West will kneel. And, as usual, European states will have to cooperate with Russia in all spheres. There can be and will be no other outcome,” Kadyrov said in an interview on Tuesday.
Units of ethnic Chechens have been on the frontline in Ukraine since the start of the campaign. Russian President Vladimir Putin praised them in September for showing “valor and exceptional courage,” noting the tradition of military service alongside other peoples from their nation.
Kadyrov regularly posts videos showcasing Chechen troops in action and reports on their progress on the ground. On occasion, he has publicly questioned some of the decisions taken by the Russian military leadership, including the withdrawal of troops from Kharkov Region in September.
At the time, the Chechen leader urged the Russian Defense Ministry to adopt a bolder offensive strategy. The ministry explained the partial pullout as helping to minimize Russian battlefield losses.
Moscow deployed troops against Ukraine in late February 2022, citing the creeping expansion of NATO and Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk Agreements of 2014-15, which were intended to form a roadmap for peace in Donbass.
Russian officials have argued that the military operation preempted an attempt by Kiev to retake by force the territories that broke away from Ukraine after the 2014 armed coup in the capital.https://www.rt.com/russia/571116-kadyrov-ukraine-operation-end/=============================================

4) --- US behind Nord Stream sabotage – legendary NYT journalist
Washington “took out” the Russian gas pipelines, Seymour Hersh has claimed
The Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed last September by the US in a covert operation, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has claimed. The legendary reporter made the bombshell revelation in an article posted to his newly launched blog on Substack on Wednesday.
The explosives were planted at the pipelines back in June 2022 by US Navy divers under the guise of the BALTOPS 22 NATO exercise, Hersh reported, citing a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning.
The journalist noted that he had reached out to the White House and CIA for comment, with both firmly rejecting the claim that the US “took out” the pipelines as “utterly false.”
The bombs were detonated three months later on September 26 with a remote signal sent by a sonar buoy. The buoy was dropped near the Nord Stream pipelines by a Norwegian Navy P8 surveillance plane, according to the report.
The operation came to fruition following months of back-and-forth between the White House, CIA, and military, with officials focusing on how to leave no trace of US involvement in the attack. The planning process began back in December 2021, when a special task force was created with the direct participation of US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.
“The Navy proposed using a newly commissioned submarine to assault the pipeline directly. The Air Force discussed dropping bombs with delayed fuses that could be set off remotely. The CIA argued that whatever was done, it would have to be covert. Everyone involved understood the stakes,” the report read.
The source told Hersh that everybody involved understood the operation was not some “kiddie stuff” but was actually an “an act of war.” Throughout “all of this scheming” certain officials urged the White House to drop the idea entirely. “Some working guys in the CIA and the State Department were saying, ‘Don’t do this. It’s stupid and will be a political nightmare if it comes out,’” according to the source.
Originally, the explosives were to have a 48-hour timer and were set to be planted by the end of BALTOPS22, Hersh reported, citing the same source. The two-day window, however, was ultimately deemed to be too close to the end of the exercise by the White House, which ordered the task force to come up with an on-demand method of detonating them. This ultimately turned out to be the sonar buoy.
The administration of President Joe Biden has been “focused” on jeopardizing the Nord Stream pipelines – initially through sanctions, and, ultimately, by direct sabotage – seeing it as key to swaying Europe to its cause amid the then-looming conflict in Ukraine, Hersh noted.
“As long as Europe remained dependent on the pipelines for cheap natural gas, Washington was afraid that countries like Germany would be reluctant to supply Ukraine with the money and weapons it needed to defeat Russia,” he wrote.
Moscow provided a similar take on the incident shortly after the blasts, branding them a “terrorist attack” and stating that the US was the nation that benefited most from it, by accelerating Europe’s attempts to wean itself off of Russian gas.
Throughout his career, Hersh has reported on numerous explosive stories, including war crimes by the US military and high-profile political scandals. Exposing the My Lai massacre by US troops in Vietnam scored the journalist the Pulitzer Prize in 1970. Other notable stories Hersh reported on include the Watergate scandal, the CIA illegal domestic spying, as well as the American military's torture and abuse of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.https://www.rt.com/news/571173-hersh-us-nord-stream/============================================

5) --- Ukraine purges libraries of Russian-language books – official
More than 10 million volumes have been pulled from the shelves, a senior Rada MP has said
Ukraine has removed millions of copies of Russian-language books from its public libraries, Yevgeniya Kravchuk, a senior member of the country’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, said on Monday.
She stated that the Culture Ministry had provided recommendations on what titles should be taken off the shelves.
This move was provoked by an initiative declared by the Ukrainian government to “overcome the consequences of Russification,” which in practice means purging schools of certain literature, renaming streets, and dismantling monuments to Russian historical figures.
According to Kravchuk, the deputy chair of the Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy, 19 million books had been removed as of November, including 11 million in Russian.
“Some Ukrainian-language books from the Soviet times are being removed as well,” Kravchuk said. The MP noted that there was not enough literature available in the Ukrainian language.
“The ratio of books in the Russian and Ukrainian languages in our libraries is very disheartening. We are talking about the need to update the stocks more quickly and procure books in the Ukrainian language.”
Ukraine has a sizable Russian-speaking minority, and many Ukrainian speakers are fluent in Russian.
In June, the Ukrainian Education Ministry proposed removing more than 40 books by Russian and Soviet authors from the curriculum. The list included the works of such renowned classical writers as Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Alexander Pushkin, as well as Boris Pasternak and Mikhail Sholokhov, both of whom won the Nobel Prize for literature. Ukrainian Culture Minister Aleksander Tkachenko urged the world in December to “boycott” Russian culture, arguing that Moscow has been using it for propaganda.
Since 2014, Kiev has adopted several laws aimed at restricting the use of the Russian language in the public sphere. Moscow, meanwhile, has described these moves as discriminatory. Last year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov condemned “Kiev’s policy of aggressive de-Russification and forced assimilation.”
Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine nearly a year ago, citing the need to protect the people of Donbass, a predominately Russian-speaking region, and Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk 2014-2015 peace accords.https://www.rt.com/russia/571099-ukraine-purges-russian-books/============================================8 Feb, 2023 17:41
6) --- India sends massive aid package to Türkiye and Syria
Over 100 tonnes of equipment and 200 personnel have been sent to areas affected by the devastating earthquakesBy Joydeep Sen Gupta, Asia editor
India has dispatched 130 tonnes of aid to Türkiye and another six tonnes to Syria to help with the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes that hit the countries on Monday.
On Tuesday, four C-17 aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) airlifted equipment and medicine, as well as 101 National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) personnel and 99 military medics to the disaster-hit areas. The aid packages are part of New Delhi’s human assistance and disaster relief (HADR) mission called ‘Operation Dost’, which means ‘friends’ in Hindi.
According to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the NDRF teams are self-contained rescue units. They carry a range of equipment necessary to search collapsed structures and rescue trapped survivors, such as angle cutters, rotary rescue saws, life detectors, lighting, air-lifting bags, chainsaws, hand and power tools and more. They are also accompanied by sniffer dog squads. The medical team will set up a 30-bed field hospital with operation theaters, X-ray machines and ventilators.
“One team went to Adana and another to Urfa. They will later converge at Nurdağı, one of the worst-hit areas. A third team of 51 operatives is on its way and the local administration will decide on its deployment,” NDRF Director-General Atul Karwal said at a media briefing in New Delhi on Wednesday evening.
India’s assistance was on its way even before Türkiye officially requested it, thanks to the initiative of Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said Air Marshal Balabhadra Radha Krishna.
“The rapid response of the Indian administration stemmed from its annual exercise and standard operating procedure for HADR, which helped them mobilize resources within 12 hours from when the disaster occurred. Our interoperability and synergies among key government departments were on display as this is the farthest — up to nine hours of flying time — that we’ve managed to take our HADR initiative to date,” Krishna explained.
India boosted its disaster relief capabilities after the devastating tsunami that hit the coastal part of southern India, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, Sri Lanka and several other countries in the Indian Ocean region in December 2004, killing over 227,000 people. Since then, HADR has emerged as a security provider in emergencies across the region, as well as for Indians elsewhere in the world. One of its most recent efforts was ‘Operation Ganga’, which evacuated thousands of Indians stranded in and around Ukraine in March last year.
The current death toll from Monday’s devastating earthquakes that hit southern Türkiye and northwestern Syria stands at over 11,000 people. Other affected countries include Cyprus, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Georgia and Armenia.
Türkiye’s ambassador to India, Firat Sunel, praised New Delhi’s assistance. “India’s reaction was important and critical because the first two-three days are very important as it’s a matter of life and death. India’s response was swift,” he said in an interview to abplive.com.https://www.rt.com/india/571191-india-turkiye-earthquake-aid/=============================================

7) --- Moscow reveals time frame for response to Western oil sanctions
Russia will decide on countermeasures by the end of this month, according to Deputy PM Aleksandr Novak
Russia will unveil retaliatory measures to the price ceiling introduced by the EU and G7 on its oil products by March, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak stated on Wednesday.
“We are now studying the new decisions made [by the EU and the G7 on the embargo and the price cap on fuel from Russia] in order to understand the feasibility [of a response],” Novak said. “Of course, there will be decisions before March,” added the minister.
The EU’s restrictions on Russian refined petroleum products came into force on February 5, setting a price limit of $100 per barrel for diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline coming from Russia, as well as a $45-per-barrel cap for other oil products that trade below the crude price, such as fuel oil used in industry.
The price caps, together with an EU ban on Russian oil product imports, are part of a broader agreement among the G7 countries. It follows a $60-per-barrel cap on Russian crude that the G7 along with the EU and Australia imposed on December 5.
The measures prohibit Western companies from financing, insuring, trading, brokering or carrying cargoes of Russian crude and oil products unless they were bought at or below the set price caps.
On Tuesday, however, Brussels issued exceptions to the embargo, saying Russian crude blended with petroleum products in a third country will be exempt from a price cap.
The measures will allow EU countries to continue buying Russian petroleum products such as diesel from third countries, since Moscow has prohibited any sales under the price cap scheme.
The Kremlin has called the price ceilings a non-market instrument. The Russian government has banned crude sales to buyers that mention the price caps in their contracts, promising a similar restriction regarding the EU’s latest limits on oil products.https://www.rt.com/business/571189-moscow-response-western-oil-sanctions/===========================================8 Feb, 2023 16:47
8) --- MH17 probe suspended
The international investigation team says it cannot determine who operated the missile that shot down the Malaysian Boeing
Investigators behind the criminal probe into the July 2014 downing of Malaysian flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine said on Wednesday they had not been able to find sufficient evidence that could lead to new prosecutions and are therefore suspending the investigation. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) stressed, however, that the case will be resumed if new information comes to light.
“The investigation has now reached its limit. All leads have been exhausted,” said Dutch prosecutor Digna van Boetzelaer as the JIT issued its latest report on the tragic incident.
According to the JIT, the Malaysian Boeing was shot down by a BUK surface-to-air missile. In their report, the team claims there are “strong indications” that the air defense system was provided to anti-Kiev rebels in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) on the personal orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They admit, however, that there is not enough information to meet the “high bar of complete and conclusive evidence,” which is why the investigation cannot make any definitive accusations. The team also stated that it has been unable to confirm the identities of the Russian officers believed to have been operating the BUK system allegedly responsible for the tragic incident.
The Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down as it flew over the east of Ukraine in July 2014. All 298 people on board were killed. The incident took place at a time when Ukrainian government forces were engaged in fierce battles against the rebels who opposed the outcome of an armed coup in Kiev.
Back in November, the JIT’s investigation, which was launched in 2019, was used by a Dutch court to hand out life sentences to two Russian and one Ukrainian nationals who held high-ranking positions within the DPR’s forces at the time of the incident. The court accused them of being responsible for downing the civilian airliner. All three denied the allegations and were tried in absentia. Moscow called the ruling a “politically motivated verdict” that was handed out under “unprecedented pressure” and refused to extradite its citizens.
Russia has repeatedly denied responsibility for the downing of MH17 and has insisted that Ukraine possessed the same type of weapons system used to shoot down the airliner. Moscow has also blasted the JIT probe for neglecting to include evidence provided by Russia and failing to take into account Ukraine’s failure to provide raw radar data from the day of the tragedy. Kiev insists this information is not available.https://www.rt.com/news/571185-jit-suspends-mh17-investigation/========================================

9) --- Majority of Canadians say their country is ‘broken’ – poll
Half of the people are ‘angry’ about what they view as the country’s mismanagement, a new survey shows
Over two-thirds of Canadians – 67% – believe their country is “broken,” according to poll results published Monday by the National Post and Leger. Respondents across the political spectrum see a large divide between the issues they deal with in their daily lives and the issues their government chooses to focus on.
Respondents were asked whether they agreed with Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre’s claim that “It feels like everything is broken in this country right now,” though Poilievre’s name was not mentioned. Just 25% disagreed with the statement, with the remainder undecided.
Half of respondents reported feeling “angry” with the way Canada was being managed, with two out of five of those being “very angry.” Women were slightly more likely to be angry than men, and inhabitants of the midwestern provinces – Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan – were more upset than those on either coast.
More than two-thirds (68%) of respondents named “rising costs and inflation/interest rates” as the primary issue affecting Canadians, with “the state of healthcare” also commanding 59% of the vote. “Affording a place to live” came third, named by 43% of respondents, and “jobs and the economy” rounded out the top four with 40%.
This contrasts with where Canadians believe the federal government is focusing its energies. Just 28% see Ottawa concentrating, like them, on rising costs and inflation, while 27% said “environment/climate change” was the government’s primary focus. Another 25% said the government was chiefly concerned with “Canada’s response to the war in the Ukraine [sic],” while only 14% of poll respondents listed the Ukraine conflict as a significant issue affecting their own lives. Fully 22% of respondents confessed they had no idea what the federal government was prioritizing.
Local government was seen as slightly more in touch, with 37% of poll respondents reporting their provincial leaders were most focused on healthcare, 28% on rising costs and inflation, and 27% on jobs and the economy. However, 17% of respondents said they did not know what their local government was prioritizing.
Conducted late last month, the poll surveyed 1,554 Canadians randomly recruited from an online panel.
Canadians are far from alone in their economic malaise. Recent polls show two-thirds of Americans believe their country is on the wrong track, and the economy is widely considered to be the primary challenge facing the US.https://www.rt.com/news/571186-canadians-poll-broken-economic-concerns/===========================================

9a) Nearly two-thirds of Americans say US headed wrong way – poll
President Joe Biden’s approval rating remains low, though up on last year's ratings
Nearly two out of three Americans – 65% – believe their country is on the wrong track, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday ahead of President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address. It’s a marked increase over last year, when just 58% of respondents expressed similar misgivings.
With the president set to address Congress on Tuesday evening, Biden’s public approval rating remains underwater at 41% – not quite the low of 36% it repeatedly hit last spring and summer, but still problematic for a leader looking to convince voters to award him a second term.
Biden’s State of the Union speech touted his legislative efforts in infrastructure and inflation, the latter remaining (along with ‘the economy’ in general) at the top of the list of Americans’ concerns in recent polling. The White House had told reporters Biden would lay out a ‘unity agenda’ emphasizing bipartisan cooperation on cancer research, veterans’ health, mental health in general, and the opioid epidemic.
None of those issues made Reuters’ list of the five problems most concerning to Americans, however. After the economy – which includes unemployment and jobs – the pollsters’ most recent results rank crime/corruption, immigration, environment/climate, and inequality/discrimination as the most important issues concerning Americans. In a rare show of bipartisan unity, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents agreed the economy is the nation’s number-one challenge.
Just 37% of Democrats want Biden to run for a second term as president, according to an Associated Press poll published earlier this week. Respondents cited his age, his perceived mental decline, and what they viewed as his ineffectiveness at governing in their reasons for wanting new leadership, with just 13% saying they had a lot of confidence in the president’s ability to accomplish major policy goals.
Despite his low approval ratings, however, Biden’s party pulled off a surprisingly strong showing in the 2022 midterm elections. While Republicans gained control of the House, Democrats avoided being swamped by a ‘red wave’ and maintained control of the Senate.https://www.rt.com/news/571143-americans-wrong-track-poll-biden/============================================

10) --- Museum explains why it’s removing Chinese cameras
A local senator has deemed the foreign-made devices a ‘national security’ risk
The Australian War Memorial in Canberra is taking down security cameras made in China as a precaution, the museum chair said on Wednesday. This comes during a rise in suspicion of PRC-made electronics in Australia.
The institution will be removing all security cameras made by Hikvision, a Hangzhou-based state-owned manufacturer of CCTV surveillance devices. “It’s not because we’ve had any notice of anything untoward but it’s an abundance of caution,” the newly-appointed Australian War Memorial chair Kim Beazley told the Canberra Times. The museum will gradually take down the eleven Chinese-made cameras throughout the year, stating that the Hikvision models made up a small fraction of the 200 other cameras and were not filming any “significant historical exhibits.”
Australian opposition senator and Shadow Minister for Cyber Security and Countering Foreign Interference James Paterson welcomed the decision. “A Chinese government-linked surveillance company has no place on the grounds of our most sacred monument to Australians who fought and died for freedom,” Paterson told the Canberra Times. The politician added when speaking to ABC TV that he was working on a “full audit” of the government’s departments and agencies to assess exposure to possible surveillance by Beijing. Paterson is certain that Chinese-made cameras pose “national security risks.”
Hikvision has yet to comment on the decision by the Australian museum, but it denied similar “spying” accusations from the UK in November. In a statement to news agencies, the company guaranteed that it had no visibility into end users’ video data nor did it store or sell it.Similarly, Australia’s National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) decided to remove all cameras made by Chinese company Dahua from their head office in Geelong, Victoria, according to reports by the Daily Telegraph.
Beijing has also yet to comment on the matter. When faced with these kinds of accusations from the US over Dahua and Hikvision in the past, Beijing denied that the companies were being used for spying.
Australia has previously expressed suspicion towards Chinese electronics, when Canberra barred international tech giant Huawei and ZTE from creating a 5G communication network in the country in 2018. Beijing’s ambassador, Cheng Jingye, described the measure as politically-motivated discrimination against a Chinese company.
This development comes as Washington, London, and Canberra signed the AUKUS security pact in 2021, with the proclaimed goal of “sustaining peace and stability” in the region by acquiring nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Colonel Tan Kefei slammed the agreement in December, calling it a source of nuclear proliferation as the US was “vigorously” deploying nukes in the region in December. He added that Washington needed to “abandon the Cold War mentality.”https://www.rt.com/news/571178-australia-museum-chinese-cameras/============================================

FEATURE) --- Lasers, spaceflight, surgery, nuclear power and the secrets of Mayan civilization: How Russian scientists changed the world
The country’s contributions to research and discovery impact all our lives
February 8 marks the day of Russian science, when past achievements are celebrated to inspire new generations for the future. The list of Soviet and Russian specialists who have made crucial contributions to physics, chemistry, medicine and biology amongst others is too long to outline, but their work is used every day around the world.
The Periodic Table--------------------------The Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, a basic tool used by scientists to explore matter and foresee the existence of new elements, was created by Russian scientist Dmitry Mendeleev in 1869. In 2019, the UN celebrated The International Year of the Periodic Table, to mark the 150th anniversary of the discovery it called“a window on the universe.”
Humanity has known about several chemical elements since ancient times. In the 17th century, German alchemist Hennig Brand accidentally discovered a new element – phosphorus – and triggered a wave of scientific experiments. A hundred years later, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier wrote ‘Elementary Treatise of Chemistry’, considered to be the first modern chemistry textbook.
Mendeleev was only 35 years old when he made the greatest discovery of his life.
He had suspected a relationship between the elements since he was a student, and over the years, this idea became an obsession. “...The anticipation of the imminent resolution of a question that tormented me put me in an excited state,” he recalled. “For several weeks I slept fitfully, trying to find that magical principle… And then one fine morning, after spending a sleepless night… I lay down on the sofa in the office and fell asleep. And in a dream, a table appeared to me quite clearly.” Mendeleev arranged the elements by atomic weight and noted periodicity of properties. Then, he grouped the elements with similar properties below each other.
This system allowed Mendeleev to predict the existence of further elements. In the middle of the 19th century, only about 63 elements were known whereas now 118 elements currently populate the periodic table. The latest addition, oganesson, is named after Russian nuclear scientist Yuri Oganesyan, who assisted in the discovery of several superheavy elements, now added to the table.-Field Surgery-------------------Doctor Nikolay Pirogov made an immense contribution to medicine worldwide and is often described as the “father of Russian medicine”. He is considered an innovator and was the founder of field surgery – or offering complex treatment to the wounded in the middle of combat.
Pirogov became the first surgeon to use ether as an anesthetic in 1847 while working in a field hospital. He was the main surgeon in the besieged city of Sevastopol through the Crimean War in the 1850s and was also one of the first to use orthopedic casts from plaster, which helped prevent amputation of limbs.
Pirogov further improved Russian field medicine by applying the innovations and practice of his contemporaries. During the Crimean War, Pirogov emulated Florence Nightingale by training a Russian group of female nurses. Additionally, after meeting the famous French surgeon Dominique Jean Larrey in Paris, Pirogov introduced Larrey’s triage system to the Russian army’s medical corps.-Classical Conditioning-------------------------------Even if you’ve never heard about Russian neurologist and physiologist Ivan Pavlov, you’re probably familiar with ‘Pavlov’s dog’.
While researching the digestion process of animals, Pavlov realized that dogs began to salivate when they saw the assistant who fed them. The scientist presented a stimulus – the sound of a metronome – and then fed the dog. After several attempts, the animals started to salivate in response to the stimulus.
The experiment became a base for the classical conditioning theory: An unconditioned stimulus (in Pavlov’s case – food) caused an unconditioned response (dog’s salivation). A neutral stimulus (the metronome’s sound without food) didn’t cause any reaction, but after conditioning (offered with food), the metronome’s sound became a conditioned stimulus and caused a conditioned reaction (salivation) even if food didn’t follow.
Classical conditioning helps understand the basic form of learning and is often used in behavioral therapies. Specialists also use it to investigate and treat addictions.
In 1904, Pavlov became the first Russian to be awarded The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine “in recognition of his work on the physiology of digestion, through which knowledge on vital aspects of the subject has been transformed and enlarged.”-Deciphering the Maya Script----------------------------------------“You don’t need to jump across the pyramids to understand how to work with texts” – Yuri Knorozov.
Knorozov was a Soviet linguist and ethnographer who managed to decipher the script of the Maya civilization. He published an article in 1952 proclaiming his achievement. At the time, he was just 30 years old, but perhaps more remarkable is that he had never visited Central America.
Knorozov studied Egyptology at Moscow State University, and was fascinated by the Mayan culture. As he recalled, he was heavily influenced by a 1945 article by German researcher Paul Schellhas titled, “Is deciphering of the Maya hieroglyphs an unsolvable problem?”.
While working on the Maya scripts, Knorozov demonstrated that the hieroglyphs represent sounds. Later, he composed a catalog of 540 symbols, and explained the method on how to use them to read and understand the Maya texts.
Knorosov’s work was translated into many languages and sparked discussions in the scientific community for decades. Soviet scientists led by Knorozov went on to work on the decipherment of other historical mysteries such as the rongorongo script of Easter Island and the Indus script.
In Mexico, there are monuments to Knorozov in the capital and in the Yucatan peninsula city of Merida where the Mayan civilization existed. The scientist is portrayed together with his cat Asya that Knorozov called his “co-author”.-Development of LasersIt’s extremely difficult to imagine the modern world without lasers. They are used everywhere – in medicine, industry, electronic devices and beyond. ‘Laser’ is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The creation of such devices was predicted by Albert Einstein in 1917, when he described the process of ‘stimulated emission’ – the release of energy from an excited atom by artificial means.
Before scientists developed a laser, they worked on the ‘maser’ concept (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). The research was done simultaneously in the USSR and in the US. In 1952, Soviet physicists Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov described the theoretical principles for maser operation.
Later, they proposed a principle for achieving population inversion by pumping a three-level system. This technique proved to be highly effective and is now widely used in various lasers and spectral ranges.
Simultaneously, American physicist Joseph Weber described how to use stimulated emissions to make a microwave amplifier. Using this method, physicist Charles H. Townes built the first maser.
In 1964, Basov, Prokhorov and Townes shared the Nobel Prize “for fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle.”-Optical Holography--------------------------Holography is generally best known as a method to create a 3D image, which can be seen without any special glasses or other devices. Holography itself was invented by Hungarian-British physicist Dennis Gabor in 1947. While trying to improve an electron microscope, he discovered a method to record the entire field information – amplitude and phase – and not just the usual intensity.
The breakthrough in the technology followed laser invention and development, which were distinguished from other light sources by their coherence (meaning that the wavelengths of the laser light are in phase in space and time).
In the 1960s, Soviet physicist Yuri Denisyuk created a single-beam technique to produce a high quality image. This method became widely known as “Denisyuk holography”. When a Denisyuk hologram is recorded with at least three lasers, full color holograms can be obtained.
Interestingly, Denisyuk took inspiration from the Lippmann color photography technique (interferential photography), which is a color-only technique that records the entire visible color spectrum. When a Denisyuk hologram is recorded with at least three lasers, full color holograms, depicting a very realistic image of an object, can be obtained.-Linear Programming----------------------------Soviet economist Leonid Kantorovich was the first to describe the method now known as ‘linear programming,’ used in industry and business planning, having developed the idea in the 1930s. As Kantorovich recalled, he faced a formidable task to find the optimal loading for peeling machines. While searching for an effective solution, Kantorovich took into account many other similar problems, such as the effective use of agricultural land, which all seemed to fit a certain mathematical model. In 1975, the scientist shared a Nobel Prize with Dutch economist Tjalling C. Koopmans “for their contributions to the theory of optimum allocation of resources.”
Linear programming methods have since been improved by many scientists around the world. It is widely used in microeconomics and can be applied to planning, production and transportation to minimize production costs and maximize income.-Space Exploration-------------------------It’s nearly impossible to imagine the Soviet and Russian space programs without Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, universally recognized as the “father of human spaceflight.” Apart from being a brilliant scientist, Tsiolkovsky was quite an extraordinary man. At the age of 10, he almost completely lost his hearing and was forced to dedicate himself to self-education.
Most of Tsiolkovsky’s ideas outpaced his time. In 1895, he predicted artificial satellite development and use. In 1903, he published a mathematical equation, now known as the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, describing rocket travel in space which is still used by aerospace engineers. Tsiolkovsky also envisioned and explained how future spaceships would overcome Earth's gravity, described their flight path and how they would land. Decades later, his theories became reality, brought to life by new generations of scientists and engineers.
In the 20s, schoolboy Valentin Glushko wrote several letters to Tsiolkovsky, detailing his dreams about space flight, which later became the point of his life. Glushko would go on to design rocket engines that took Soviet satellites and cosmonauts to space, as well as the “Buran” spaceplane.
Sergey Korolev is also a significant figure in the history of space exploration. He led the Soviet space program and worked on the launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite. Korolev’s guidance oversaw many other aerospace achievements including Yuri Gagarin’s ground breaking space flight, Alexey Leonov’s first human spacewalk, the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, and a number of other groundbreaking space missions.-Nuclear Reactions--------------------------Soviet and Russian atomic scientists have always been frontrunners in researching nuclear energy, and Igor Kurchatov is one of the most prominent. Kurchatov worked on the peaceful application of atomic energy while leading the Soviet nuclear weapons project. His work led to the first grid-connected nuclear power plant launched in the city of Obninsk in 1954, near Moscow.
Modern-day nuclear fusion relies heavily on the research of another globally-known Soviet physicist – Andrey Sakharov. Together with Nobel Prize-awarded scientist Igor Tamm, they developed the tokamak concept – a device that uses a powerful magnetic field to confine plasma and produce controlled thermonuclear fusion power. Their research forms the base of fusion reactor development today.
Both Kurchatov and Sakharov played key roles in the development of Soviet nuclear weapons. In 1949, a team led by Kurchatov tested the first Soviet nuclear bomb. Six years later, the first hydrogen bomb designed by Sakharov and his team was tested in the same area.-The Denisovans-----------------------In the late 2000s, Russian archeologists made a surprising discovery: They found a new species of archaic human. They named it “The Denisovan”, after the Denisova cave where it was found. The cave’s location is in the Altai mountains in Siberia.
Archeological work at the site began in the 1970s. In 1990, Anatoly Derevyanko from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Science established a special research center in the area.
In 2008, a group of scientists led by Mikhail Shunkov found a finger bone of a young female. The bone contained well-preserved DNA, which was sequenced by the team of Swedish researcher Svante Pääbo at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany. Following a series of tests, in 2010 they announced that the genetic material belongs to a previously unknown hominin.
Scientists now believe the Denisovans may have lived in the cave some 200 thousand years ago. The work in the Denisova cave continues, and likely holds even more secrets of human history.https://www.rt.com/russia/571060-day-of-russian-science/=============================================

and viruses once scientists understood that insects could indeed acquire immunity and pass it to their offspring Dr friedak said about answering the question of how they did so in 2015 she and two other researchers identified the specific protein that prompts an immune response in The Offspring and realized they could cultivate immunity in a bee population with a single queen their first goal was tackling American falbrude a bacterial disease that turns larvae dark brown and makes the hive give off a rotting smell the disease ran rampant during the 1800s and the early 1900s in B colonies in parts of the United States while American fallbrood is not as destructive as varroa mites the bacterium can easily wipe out colonies of 60 000 bees the introduction of a vaccine comes at a critical moment for honeybees which are vital to the world's food system but are also declining globally because of climate change pesticides habitat loss and disease there is no Silver Bullet but there is a toxic stew of causation and some of that includes diseases that are new and some that are old and familiar said Keith delaplane a professor professor of Entomology at the University of Georgia and the director of its honeybee program which provided research grounds for Dallin its Death By A Thousand Cuts by pollinating food as they feed on pollen and nectar honeybees pollinate about one-third of the food crops in the United States and help produce an estimated 15 billion dollar worth of crops in the United States each year many beekeepers lease their hives across the country to assist in pollination of almonds pears cherries apples and other types of produce at least three quarters of flowering plants require the assistance of pollinators including bees butterflies and moths to produce fruit and seeds Chris Hyatt who keeps bees in North Dakota and California and is the president of the American Honey producers Association participated in the vaccine trial over the summer with about 800 queen bees in North Dakota for beekeepers you just don't want to be reliant on antibiotics which most beekeepers give once a year or when there are flare-ups he said antibiotics can wipe out some of the beneficial microbes this has the potential to add other things too Annette kleiser the chief executive of Dallin called the vaccine a huge breakthrough these are livestock and should have the same modern tools to care for them and protect them that we have for our chickens cats dogs and so on Miss kleiser said the conditional approval provides a mechanism that allows companies to accelerate approval for vaccines if they demonstrate there is a high unmet need in the market Ms kleiser said the agency realizes that these new tools are needed in the market to help

the American fallbrood vaccine as a map to produce vaccines for other diseases that affect honeybees when we started there was no regulatory path she said no one has ever developed an insect vaccine

				The Insured is Obligated to Read the Insurance Policy
Every person that acquires a policy of insurance, whether designed to protect a dwelling, a commercial property, agriculture, crops from destruction by the actions of nature, or from liability arising from claims of torts, or cyber-attacks, must read and understand the policy before it is acquired to determine it provides the coverage requested. It must be read again before making a claim to an insurer.
A majority of the courts that have been called upon to interpret an insurance policy require that the person seeking insurance must read the insurance contract or - at the very least - have, a lawyer or insurance professional read, understand and explain the policy to the person acquiring the insurance.
For the last 55 years I have asked people making claims on an insurance policy whether they have read and understood their insurance policy. Most just laughed and claimed they never tried. Two, in my career, answered ""yes."" After further questioning it became obvious that both lied since they knew nothing about the terms or conditions of the policy, they claimed they had read and understood. These facts horrify me as an insurance coverage lawyer, a consultant and an expert witness testifying in courts across the United States about the purchase and sale of insurance contracts and insurance claims handling.
My career, starting as a trainee adjuster in 1967 and later as an insurance coverage lawyer required that I read, understand and apply insurance policies issued by my clients to individuals and businesses. I have written, edited or revised, policies of insurance on behalf of insurer clients. I even read insurance policies I acquire to protect my property and protect me against tort liability before I order the policy. I know I am unusual, but I should not be. My practice should be the norm.
What is Insurance?
Many states have different definitions of the word ""insurance"" but each have the same essential elements:
It must be a written contract.One party (the insurer) agrees with the other (the insured) as to the insurance provided.The insurer, for consideration (payment of a premium) agrees to indemnify the insured against a contingent or unknown event.The promise to indemnify is limited to certain identified risks of loss arising from a fortuitous, contingent or unknown event.
Insurance is a contract like all other contracts. No one should enter into a contract ignorant of its terms and conditions. Many people would never sign a lease without reading it. No businessperson will sign a lease until he or she has been advised by a lawyer representing the businessperson alone, of its terms, conditions, limitations, and whether it is favorable to the person seeking to lease commercial property. No one should agree to the terms of a mortgage without reading the contract. Insurance contracts, however, are almost never read by the person insured. Some are not read by the agent, broker or underwriter who sell the insurance, or the lawyers retained to enforce it. Yet hundreds of hours of the work of insurance professionals are involved in the writing of policies of insurance.
There is no viable excuse for not reading an insurance policy. Modern insurance policies, as a result of state statutes, are required to be written in plain language or easy to read language sufficient for anyone with a fourth‑grade education to understand. I describe the modern language of insurance policies as ""Sesame Street English.""
Why, then, do people fail to read their insurance policy?
Insurance policies have a bad reputation. People believe insurance policies are impossible to understand. Courts in the past have encouraged this belief. Policies are believed by the common person to be confusing and complicated. Sections of the contract are frequently cross‑referenced to other sections of the policy, often in a convoluted way.
Insurance companies strive to make their policies as clear as possible because when coverage is subject to a legal challenge, ambiguity in the language will always be interpreted in a way that favors the insured, not the insurer.
For example, in Insurance Company of North America v. Electronic Purification Company, 67 Cal. 2d 679, 689, 63 Cal. Rptr. 382, 433 (1967) the California Supreme Court noted:
[T]he insurance company gave the insured coverage in relatively simple language easily understood by the common man in the marketplace but attempted to take away a portion of this same coverage in paragraphs and language which even a lawyer, be he from Philadelphia or Bungy, would find difficult to comprehend.
Courts, called upon to interpret or enforce a contract of insurance, will always conclude that if an insurance contract is neither ambiguous nor difficult to comprehend, it will be enforced as written. [Sharbono v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 139 Wash. App. 383, 394 (2007)]
If twenty‑first century judges want to make better sense of the insurance area of law, they should start by understanding and admitting that:
Almost nobody reads everything he or she signs;Almost nobody is able to read everything he or she signs;What drafters do want is to be able to treat those insured as if he or she had read everything.Drafters of insurance policies do not care if, in fact, he or she has not - and, indeed, in many cases would prefer that he or she did not.Do not call it a duty. That just adds insult to injury.
However, it is black letter law that one who knowingly and voluntarily assents to a contract whose terms are contained in a writing should be held legally responsible for his or her actions by being held to those terms, in the absence of fraud, mistake, or other excusing cause.
A party cannot negotiate, enter into and perform under a contract, only to later claim that it objected to some provision of the contract and thus retained a mental reservation to the terms of the agreement. Such a holding creates the risk that any disgruntled party may belatedly assert a lack of ""voluntary"" assent to a contract that it executed and performed. [DJ Mortg., LLC v. Synovus Bank, 750 S.E.2d 797, 325 Ga.App. 382 (Ga. App. 2013)]
Whether almost no one reads their insurance policies, and my experience seems to establish the fact, that fact does not make them less effective contracts. An adhesion contract only means the person offering the contract gives the person to whom it is offered only two choices:
accept the contract orreject the contract.
If accepted the contract is enforceable.
Plain Language Policies
The need for - plain language - in an insurance policy was first described in the United States in the early 1950s. The Federal Government's most recent plain‑language initiative began in 1998, when President Clinton issued a Memorandum on Plain Language in Government Writing to the heads of executive departments and agencies. He said:
We are determined to make the Government more responsive, accessible, and understandable in its communications with the public. By using plain language, we send a clear message about what the Government is doing, what it requires, and what services it offers. Plain language saves the Government and the private sector time, effort, and money. [President Clinton. Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Plain Language in Government Writing. June 1, 1998.
There is no one generally accepted definition of plain language or plain English. But most people agree that a plain‑language document is one in which people can:
Find what they need,Understand what they find, andAct appropriately on that understanding.
Key elements of plain language are to:
Organize information so the most important behavioral or action points come first;Break complex information into understandable chunks;Use simple language or define technical terms; andProvide ample white space so pages look easy to read.
In addition to the key elements, there are dozens of plain‑language guidelines and techniques such as using short sentences and active voice when possible. Document design principles highlight the importance of organization and format and enhance the impact of plain language.
Good document design required bringing together prose, graphics and typography for purposes of instruction, information, or persuasion. Plain language does not require the writer of an insurance policy to - dumb down - the policy or eliminate the required precision necessary to make a contract enforceable.
Sometimes, insurance professionals are concerned that using plain language will oversimplify information to the point where it is inaccurate or worthless. Plain language is not anti‑intellectual, unsophisticated, drab, or inadequate. Plain language has to do with clear and effective communication  and should be considered nothing more nor less.
It is the style of Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, and Winston Churchill Plain language is not just about vocabulary or grade level. Writing to a certain grade level does not necessarily ensure that the message is in plain language or understood by the intended audience. All materials, all terms and all conditions, especially in an insurance policy, should be evaluated for understanding with the intended users, regardless of grade‑level score.
States followed the direction set by the federal government and required insurers to modify their insurance policies to be written in plain language. In doing so, the plain language insurance policies took away the argument that the policy was too hard to understand and, for that reason, should not be enforced to the detriment of the insurer.
So, why, with the new, easy to read, plain language policies, do people fail to read the insurance policy? There is no logical answer. Perhaps it is the imbedded prejudice that makes some people believe they could never understand a policy even if they tried to read it. More likely it is simply the fact that most people trust the insurance agent or broker who obtained the policy for them and trust – often, without cause – the agent or broker to get the coverages they needed.
From my 55‑years reading and interpreting insurance contracts I can only say that those people who did not read their policy get very upset when their insurance agent or broker tells them they acquired the best available policy and that it covers almost everything. However, in fact, it does not mean the policy covered every possible contingency.
When an adjuster or lawyer points out that there is no available coverage for their claim, they contend they were deceived. Had the insured read the policy before it was acquired, he or she would know that no insurance policy covers every possible risk of loss faced by a person or business. Some risks of loss are difficult, if not impossible, to insure. Consider the risk of loss by war, atomic attack, earthquake, flood, etc. can be insured but only for extremely high premium and deductibles or self‑insured retentions so expensive to make such coverages unsaleable.
Most insurance policies, as a result, exclude - in clear and unambiguous language  - coverage for those extreme risks. The person insured who does not read the policy will be upset when his property is destroyed by a flood or earthquake. Had he read the policy and wanted coverage for earthquake or flood he or she would have been directed to a specialty insurer who is in business to issue a policy - probably expensive - that provides that coverage.
The duty to read a policy appears in multiple jurisdictions. For example: In Georgia, the insured has a duty to read and understand the policy. [Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Coleman, 530 S.E.2d 229, 231 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000)] An insured who can read is required to read the policy and is presumed to have understood its contents.
Any failure of an insured to acknowledge or notice these terms cannot circumvent a clear provision in the Certificate, as “[a]n insured has the duty to read the insurance policy or have it read to him or her.” [Jin Chai-Chen v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 141 N.Y.S.3d 41, 43 (1st Dept. 2021); Am. S.S. Owners Mut. Prot. & Indem. Assn v. Carnival PLC (S.D. N.Y. 2022)]
In Mississippi, a plaintiff is deemed as a matter of law to have read and understood the terms and conditions of his insurance contract. [Mladineo v. Schmidt, 52 So.3d 1154, 1167 (Miss. 2010)]. Under the duty‑to‑read and imputed‑knowledge doctrines, an insured is deemed to have knowledge of his insurance policy. An insured may not neglect or purposefully omit acquainting himself with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and then complain of his ignorance of them.
In Zaremba Equip, Inc v Harco Nat'l Ins Co, 280 Mich.App. 16; 761 N.W.2d 151 (2008) the Michigan Court of Appeal noted that an insured's duty to read insurance policy documents does not preclude a negligence action against the insurance agent. In that case, the plaintiff alleged negligence against the insurance agent on the basis that the agent failed to obtain the requested coverage or accurately represent the coverage obtained in the renewal policy. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff, and on appeal the Court of Appeal held that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on comparative negligence regarding the plaintiff's failure to read the insurance policy and related documents. Because plaintiff's negligence claims in the instant case were tort-based, the Court of Appeal concluded that the plain language of the relevant statutes i.e., the comparative fault statutes, required the trial court to give defendants' requested instruction regarding comparative negligence. In addition, the Court of Appeal concluded that plaintiff's admitted failure to read the policy could qualify as comparative negligence and that the trial court should have permitted the jury to consider whether plaintiff unreasonably failed to read the insurance policy and related documents. [Holman v. Farm Bureau Gen. Ins. Co. (Mich. App. 2022)]
In Texas, misrepresentation claims accrue when the policy is issued because the insured has a duty to read the policy and is responsible for understanding the policy's terms and conditions. [Khoei v. Stonebridge Life Insurance Co., No. H‑13‑2181, 2014 WL 585399, at *7 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 14, 2014).] Under Texas law, an insurance agent has no duty to explain policy terms, and the insured has a duty to read his [or her] insurance policy and is bound by its terms even if they were not fully explained. [Avila v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 147 F. Supp. 2d 570, 581 (W.D. Tex. 1999); Dike v. Penn Ins. & Annuity Co., 295 F.Supp.3d 530 (E.D. Pa., 2018)]
In Alabama, the insured was under a duty to read his insurance policy. [Alfa Life Ins. Corp. v. Reese, 185 So. 3d 1091, 1102‑04 (Ala. 2015)] Similarly, in West Virginia, a party to a contract has a duty to read the instrument. [Soliva v. Shand, Morahan & Co., Inc., 176 W. Va. 430, 345 S.E.2d 33 (1986)] Finding that an insured had a duty to read the coverage reduction provision, as directed by his insurer. [American States Ins. Co. v. Surbaugh, 231 W. Va. 288, 299, 745 S.E.2d 179, 190 (2013)] In so ruling, the West Virginia supreme court explained:
In simple terms, the Court's decision is based on the premise that consumers do not read (and even if they do read, cannot understand) the terms that insurance companies use in insurance policies. Insurance companies give consumers the impression that they have full coverage under a comprehensive policy, and routinely fail to tell the consumer in plain English of the existence and the meaning of the legalistic exclusions that the insurance company has buried in a policy. So, when an insurance company seeks to avoid liability on an automobile insurance policy through the use of an exclusion, courts should first determine whether the insurance company created a reasonable expectation of coverage in the consumer, and whether the insurance company eliminated that expectation by telling the policyholder (1) that their coverage has been reduced or eliminated by the exclusion, and (2) that their premiums have been reduced to reflect the exclusion. [Mitchell v. Broadnax, 208 W.Va. 36, 537 S.E.2d 882 (W. Va., 2000)]
In California, the general rule is that one who assents to a contract is bound by its provisions and cannot complain of unfamiliarity with the language of the instrument. [Madden v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 17 Cal. 3d 699, 710 (1976).] An insured has a duty to read his policy. [Fields v. Blue Shield of Cal., 163 Cal.App.3d 570, 578 (1985).] If the language of an insurance contract is in fact clear and unequivocal, a party will be bound by its plain meaning, because >an insured has a duty to read his insurance policy. [Hallowell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 443 A.2d 925] Also, generally, a contracting party should discover mistakes at the time the contract is executed. [John HancockMut. Life Ins. Co. v. Cohen, 254 F.2d 417, 423 (9th Cir. 1958) (noting “one who is presented with an insurance policy has the duty to read it,” and finding this applies equally to the company issuing the policy); Lennar Mare Island, 139 F.Supp.3d at 1165 (finding insurer should have discovered mistake at time of signing insurance contract); Fin. Indem. Co. v. Messick (E.D. Cal. 2022)]
In Indiana, an insured has a duty to read and become familiar with the contents of an insurance policy. [National Mut. Ins. Co. v. Curtis, 867 N.E.2d 631, 635 (Ind.Ct.App.2007). However, a different scenario arises if an insured relies upon the representation of the insurer or its agent that a particular loss is covered, as reasonable reliance upon an agent's representations as to what will be covered under a policy can override the insured's duty to read the policy.[Filip v. Block, 879 N.E.2d 1076, 1084 (Ind.2008) (citing Village Furniture, Inc. v. Associated Ins. Managers, Inc., 541 N.E.2d 306, 308 (Ind.Ct.App.1989)]
In New Mexico, it is a fundamental tenet of contract law Athat each party to a contract has a duty to read and familiarize himself with the contents of the contract, each party generally is presumed to know the terms of the agreement, and each is ordinarily bound thereby.” [Ballard v. Chavez, 1994‑NMSC‑007, & 8, 868 P.2d 646, 648.]
Under Washington law, the insured has an affirmative duty to read her policy and be on notice of the terms and conditions of that policy. [Dombrosky v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Washington, 54 Wash.App. 245, 257, 928 P.2d 1127 (1996); Int'l Marine Underwriters v. ABCD Marine, LLC, 313 P.3d 395, 402 n.14 (Wash. 2013)]
In North Carolina, a person of mature years of sound mind who can read or write who signs or accepts a deed or formal contract affecting his pecuniary interest, it is his duty to read it, and knowledge of the contents will be imputed to him. Where an insured failed to use reasonable diligence by not reading the insurance policy he was not allowed to complain. [Holmes v. Sheppard, 805 S.E.2d 371, 376 (N.C. App. 2017)]
Generally, in North Carolina, State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Gaylor, 190 N.C. App. 448, 452, 660 S.E.2d 104, 107 (2008), requires persons entering contracts of insurance, like other contracts, to have a duty to read them and ordinarily are charged with knowledge of their contents. Where a party has reasonable opportunity to read the instrument in question, and the language of the instrument is clear, unambiguous and easily understood, failure to read the instrument bars that party from asserting its belief that the policy contained provisions which it does not. The events, communications, and documents in the record should only have alerted plaintiffs of the need to investigate their potential insurance coverage and make certain of any applicable insurance policies as soon as possible. [JBL Commc'ns, Inc. v. Amco Ins. Co., 865 S.E.2d 373(Table) (N.C. App. 2021)]
Applying federal law, an Oregon District Court made clear that the insured had a duty to read the policy and acted unreasonably in relying on adjusters provided only as a A courtesy by an insurer fulfilling a National Flood Insurance policy. [Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 385 (1947)); Surfsand Resort, LLC v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. (D. Or., 2018)]
Given the special nature of the insurance relationship involved under the NFIP, courts have made it clear that an insured has a duty to read and understand the terms of its SFIP. [Richmond Printing LLC v. Dir. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, 72 F. App'x 92, 98 (5th Cir. 2003)]
In Illinois, the court has specifically recognized an insured's duty to read an insurance policy. [Perelman v. Fisher, 298 Ill. App. 3d 1007 1011, 233 Ill. Dec. 88, 700 N.E.2d 189 (1998)] When an insured sues his or her insurer after failing to note a discrepancy between the policy issued and received and the policy requested or expected, the insured will be bound by the contract terms because he or she is under a duty to read the policy. [First Mercury Ins. Co. v. Ciolino, 2018 IL App (1st) 171532, 107 N.E.3d 240 (Ill. App., 2018)]
In Michigan, an insurance policy is, like any other contract, an agreement between two parties. [Tenneco Inc v. Amerisure Mut. Ins. Co., 281 Mich. App. 429, 444; 761 N.W.2d 846 (2008).] The goal in the interpretation of a contract is to honor the intent of the parties. [Klapp v. United Ins. Group Agency, Inc, 468 Mich 459, 473; 663 N.W.2d 447 (2003)]. The primary source of a policy of insurance is the language of the contract itself. [City of Grosse Pointe Park, 473 Mich. at 197‑198. Thus, insurance policies are enforced according to their terms, and a court may not hold an insurer liable for a risk it did not assume.] [Liparoto Const, Inc. v. Gen Shale Brick, Inc., 284 Mich. App. 25, 35; 772 N.W.2d 801 (2009).]
In ordinary circumstances, the insured has no duty to read a renewal policy sent to him or her and may assume that the renewed policy contains the same terms and conditions as the previous policy unless warned that the renewal policy has changed. [Government Employees Ins. Co. v. United States, 400 F.2d 172, 175 (10th Cir. 1968); Whiteside v. New Castle Mut. Ins. Co., 595 F.Supp. 1096 (D. Del., 1984)]
Reliance on Superior Expertise of Others
An insured Plaintiff had a right to rely on the superior expertise of his, her or its agent and had the right to assume that its agent performed its duty. Thus, contrary to the defendant's contention, the plaintiff had no duty to read the policy if he, she or it relied on the superior expertise of the agent. [United Olympic Life Ins. Co. v. Gunther, 19 F.3d 1441, 1994 WL 96328 (9th Cir., 1994)]
In Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has stated that the idea that people do not read or are under no duty to read a written insurance policy is not novel [Rempel v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co., Inc., 471 Pa. 404, 370 A.2d 366, 368 (1977); Tran v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 408 F.3d 130 (3rd Cir., 2005); (citing Dowling v. Merchs. Ins. Co., 168 Pa. 234, 31 A. 1087 (1895)]. The Rempel court elaborated on this principle and held that the policyholder had no duty to read the policy unless under the circumstances it is unreasonable not to read it and held that the question of whether policyholders' reliance on the agent's allegedly fraudulent representations was justifiable should be presented to the jury. [Tran v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 408 F.3d 130 (3rd Cir., 2005)] It was also held that the policyholder has no duty to read the policy unless under the circumstances it is unreasonable not to read it. [Tonkovic v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 513 Pa. 445, 521 A.2d 920 (Pa., 1987)]
In Kansas, the courts provide an insured an exception to the requirement that the insured read the policy. The Tenth Circuit found it clear that in Kansas the insured may assume that an insurance policy will conform to the application. The insured may rely on this assumption and is under no duty to read the policy to see whether it does in fact conform. [Stamps v. Consolidated Underwriters, 205 Kan. 187, 468 P.2d 84; German American Ins. Co. v. Darrin, 80 Kan. 578, 103 P. 87. The purpose of allowing such relief is to make the insurance policy reflect the expectations of the insureds when they executed the application. [Rider v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 514 F.2d 780 (10th Cir., 1975)]
Only a Fiduciary is Obligated to Read or Explain the Terms of the Policy to the Insured
An agent or broker has no duty to read or explain the terms of the contract to the insured absent a special, fiduciary relationship. [Smith v. Union Nat'l. Life Ins. Co., 286 F.Supp.2d 782, 787 (S.D.Miss. 2003)]. Mississippi law imposes no fiduciary duties on an insurance agent to an insured. [Walden v. Am. Gen. Life, 244 F.Supp.2d 689, 696-97 (S.D.Miss. 2003); Hicks v. N. Am. Co. for Life & Health Ins., 47 So.3d 181, 191 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010; Wilson v. Kemper Corp. Servs. (S.D. Miss. 2022)]
When a court held that there may be no duty to read an insurance policy where misrepresentation and concealment are alleged under certain circumstances an insurer may be liable for misrepresentation or failure to deliver agreed‑upon coverage where the agent misleads the insured as to the extent of coverage, even though the insured did not read the policy and discover the actual extent of the coverage. [Lin v. John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company, B189108 (Cal. App. 4/30/2007) (Cal. App., 2007)]
It has long been the law in Oklahoma that an insured's failure to promptly examine a policy and discover departure from an insurance agent's assurances does not defeat reformation of the policy. [Commercial Casualty Insurance Co. v. Varner, 160 Okl. 141, 16 P.2d 118 (1932), followed by Warner v. Continental Casualty Co., 534 P.2d 695 (Okla.App.1975).] Under Oklahoma law, an insured has no duty to read his written policy and notice discrepancies between it and previous representations of a soliciting agent. [Business Interiors, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., 751 F.2d 361 (10th Cir., 1984)]
The Insurance Contract is Usually Enforceable as Written
If the contract is accepted, it should be binding upon both parties as long as it is clear and unambiguous and none of the exceptions to the requirement that the policy must be read by the insured it will be enforced as written.
I don't believe it is necessary to change the language used by a court interpreting an insurance contract. I only expect that the court will interpret the contract as binding as long as it is clear and unambiguous and was not obtained as a result of mistake, misrepresentation of material fact, concealment of material fact or fraud.
There is no question that most people, regardless of case law, do not read their insurance policy. Whether read or not all of those contracts are enforceable, and no one should argue that the terms should be ignored because they were not read.
Courts, interpreting insurance policies, seeking to deal fairly and in good faith with both parties to the insurance contract, must:
Recognize that all parties to the insurance contract are required to treat each other with the utmost good faith and do nothing to deprive the other of the benefits of the contract.Read every word in the insurance policy from:the cover sheet, tothe declarations page, tothe basic wording, toall endorsements, and every other word up tothe signature by the insurer.Identify all parties to the contract.Determine whether the policy was acquired from an insurance agent representing the insurer or a broker representing the insured.Determine if the insured actually read the policy before ordering it.Determine if the insured read the policy after it was issued and delivered to the insured.Determine if any specialist B lawyer, risk manager, insurance consultant, agent or broker B advised the insured about the contents of the policy.Determine if any mistakes were made in the production of the policy wording.Determine if either party:Misrepresented a material fact.Concealed a material fact.Deceived the other.Attempted fraud.Defrauded the other.Determine if the policy wording contains any ambiguity that would affect the rights and obligations of the parties.Find the best way for each of the parties to the contract obtain the benefits of the contract.Determine how each party has treated the other with the utmost good faith and fair dealing.Make a ruling that is fair, reasonable, and allows the parties to the contract to keep the promises made.Is Failure to Read a Policy a Defense to Negligence of the Agent or Insurer?
An insured has no right to rely on an agent's patently absurd interpretation of a policy. An insured may rightfully rely on an agent's plausible interpretation of a policy, so long as the interpretation does not conflict with the printed policy. [Flamme v. Wolf Ins. Agency, 239 Neb. 465, 476 N.W.2d 802 (1991); Bayer v. Lutheran Mut. Life Ins. Co., 184 Neb. 826, 172 N.W.2d 400 (1969).]
If an insured could have read and understood the policy, then the insured should be charged with knowledge of the policy's contents. By analogy to misrepresentation rules and the rationale for those rules, the court will usually hold that absent a reason for the insured's failure to read the policy, if a policy provision is clear and unambiguous, then the insured's failure to read the policy provision will insulate the agent from liability for failure to explain that provision.
This holding comports with decisions from other state courts.
[Underwriters Adjusting Co. v. Knight, 193 Ga.App. 759, 389 S.E.2d 24 (1989) (insured's claim against agent for failure to procure proper insurance is defeated by the insured's failure to read the policy);Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Arnold, 175 Ga.App. 850, 334 S.E.2d 733 (1985) (insured's claim against agent for failure to procure proper insurance was not defeated because a reading of the policy would not have revealed the defect);Barnes v. Levenstein, 160 Ga.App. 115, 286 S.E.2d 345 (1981) (insured's claim against agent for failure to procure proper coverage is defeated because reading the policy would have informed the insured of the lacking coverage and because there was no good reason why the insured had failed to read the policy);Heritage Manor of Blaylock v. Petersson, 677 S.W.2d 689 (Tex.App.1984) (insured had a duty to read the policy and, failing to do so, would be charged with knowledge of its contents).Town & Country Mut. Ins. Co. v. Savage, 421 N.E.2d 704 (Ind.App.1981) (insured's failure to read the policy can be raised as contributory negligence);Martini v. Beaverton Ins. Agency, Inc., 314 Or. 200, 838 P.2d 1061 (1992) (insured's failure to read the policy can be raised as contributory negligence).
Several courts have held, similarly, that an agent has no duty to explain clear and unambiguous policy terms.  [Bush v. Mayerstein-Burnell Financial Services, 499 N.E.2d 755 (Ind.App.1986); Banker v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., 363 Pa. Super. 456, 526 A.2d 434 (1987); Dahlke v. John F. Zimmer Ins. Agency, Inc., 515 N.W.2d 767, 245 Neb. 800 (Neb. 1994)]
When a plaintiff's admitted failure to read the policy qualifies as comparative negligence a trial court should have permitted the jury to consider whether plaintiff unreasonably failed to read the insurance policy and related documents. [Holman v. Farm Bureau Gen. Ins. Co. (Mich. App. 2022)]
Where a party has reasonable opportunity to read the instrument in question, and the language of the instrument is clear, unambiguous and easily understood, failure to read the instrument bars that party from asserting its belief that the policy contained provisions which it does not. [Jasmen Corp. v. Edwards (E.D. N.C. 2022)]
The Virginia Supreme Court, in General Ins. of Roanoke, Inc. v. Page, 464 S.E.2d 343, 250 Va. 409 (1995) the defendant agent contended on appeal, as it did at trial, that the insured, Page's, failure to read the insurance policy constituted negligence, as a matter of law, and that such negligence proximately caused his losses and precluded recovery against it.
A person who signs an application for life insurance without reading the application or having someone read it to him is chargeable with notice of the application's contents and is bound thereby. [Peoples Life Ins. Co. v. Parker, 179 Va. 662, 667, 20 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1942); Royal Insurance Co. v. Poole, 148 Va. 363, 376-77, 138 S.E. 487, 491 (1927).] Similarly, failure of a grantor to read a deed will not relieve him of obligations contained therein. [Carter v. Carter, 223 Va. 505, 509, 291 S.E.2d 218, 221 (1982).] In Metro Realty v. Woolard, 223 Va. 92, 99, 286 S.E.2d 197, 200 (1982) held that absent fraud, one who has capacity to understand written document and signs it without reading it or having it read to him is bound thereby.]
In Oregon, the Supreme Court noted that although the parties and the trial court characterized the issue as whether plaintiff had a ""duty to read the insurance policy,"" it refused to deal with duty but, rather, emphasized that the issue is not whether plaintiff had a ""duty."" Rather, the issues are framed more precisely this way:
May defendant raise plaintiff's failure to read the policy as a specification of comparative fault?Was there evidence from which the jury could have found that, in the circumstances of this case, it was unreasonable in the light of foreseeable risks for plaintiff not to read the policy and that plaintiff's unreasonable failure to read the policy contributed to his damages?The answer both of those questions was ""yes.""
The trial court committed reversible error when it struck defendant's specification of comparative fault alleging that plaintiff failed to read the insurance policy after obtaining the policy from defendant and when it instructed the jury not to consider plaintiff's failure to read the insurance policy in assessing his comparative fault. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the trial court. [Martini v. Beaverton Ins. Agency, Inc., 314 Or. 200, 838 P.2d 1061 (Or. 1992)]
In Kentucky, the Supreme Court, unlike other courts, concluded that the trial court erred when it found appellants contributorily negligent by virtue of their failure to read and understand the fire insurance. [Grisby v. Mountain Valley Ins. Agency, Inc., 795 S.W.2d 372 (Ky. 1990)]
In New Jersey, the comparative fault defense traditionally will not apply in a plaintiff's suit alleging a professional's malpractice, at least in those cases in which the defendant argues that the plaintiff was at fault in failing to understand or to perform the task for which the professional was hired. The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that the comparative negligence defense is unavailable to a professional insurance broker who asserts that the client failed to read the policy and failed to detect the broker's own negligence. It is the broker, not the insured, who is the expert, and the client is entitled to rely on that professional's expertise in faithfully performing the very job he or she was hired to do. [Aden v. Fortsh, 169 N.J. 64, 776 A.2d 792 (N.J. 2001)]
In Frank B. Hall & Co. v. Beach, Inc., 733 S.W.2d 251 the ""failure to read"" defense was raised after the insured sued the broker, Frank B. Hall & Co., and the carrier for failure to pay a claim, violations of the DTPA and negligence. Hall affirmatively pled failure to read the policies as a defense and the insured's president admitted that he did not read the policies. Hall contended the trial court erred in failing to submit its requested issue to the jury regarding negligence in failing to read the insurance policies. The court agreed that Hall's issues on failure to read the policies should have been submitted as to the negligence issue. The court stated contributory negligence was a common-law defense and thus could not be used to defeat recovery under Texas statutes. The court determined this rule was equally applicable to Insurance Code claims and held any contributory negligence attributable to the insured could not defeat recovery on its Insurance Code claims. [Wyly v. Integrity Ins. Solutions, 502 S.W.3d 901 (Tex. App. 2016)]
In conclusion, if insurance companies are to be required to so frame their policies so that the purchaser may easily understand just what he is getting in the way of coverage for his insurance dollar, it is a matter which addresses itself to the sound discretion of the lawmaking authority.
It is not the function of courts to make contracts for the parties nor to protect the unwary purchaser of an insurance policy against his failure to read carefully and understand the extreme limitations of the protection afforded him by the terms of a cheap insurance policy. [Foster v. North American Acc. Ins. Co., 86 S.W.2d 476 (Tex. App. 1935)]
The Law of Unintended Consequences
It took quite a few years but finally the Legislatures enacted the “easy to read” statutes compelling insurers to use common language easily understood by the public. In so doing, policies became less precise and contrary to the intent of the statutes, there is more litigation claiming ambiguities in insurance contracts that must be construed against the insurer. The law of unintended consequences took hold and easy to read policies have grown insurance coverage litigation logarithmically.

!!!Attention chicken customers!!!

Small family farms in Georgia are under attack by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. In 2020 we went through a long process to obtain a 1000 bird pastured poultry exemption in the state of Georgia. We were visited by the GDA this week. We had been told that some laws or Guidelines were changing. We had no idea that those changes would end our ability to provide a better choice when it comes to poultry, chicken and Turkey. Yes you read that right. We can no longer produce and sell chicken and Turkey that was raised, processed and packaged on our farm. It’s not the growing process they care about. The new guidelines said very little about the birds themselves. It was all about the processing. An up front investment that we have roughly estimated to be between $25,000 and $30,000. This is only an exemption for 1000 birds!!!

Andrew Clyde, R-GA, led 45 of his colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Marty Walsh expressing strong concerns. The other seven Republican members of the Georgia delegation also signed the letter. The letter is in response to the release of a report in late November from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service which included an annual average fiscal-year increase across all states of 7 percent on the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) for 2023. The lawmakers also called this proposal “disastrous,” in their letter. They wrote: “Every farm labor region and state experienced a higher average wage rate in 2022, and now faces the risk of a substantially higher increase in the AEWR in 2023 over 2022. In a downturn economy, this would be disastrous for our states’ farmers, ranchers, and fruit and vegetable growers, often short-handed to harvest specialty crops.” Clyde is concerned about the impact this will have on Georgia. “This unsustainable and unrealistic increase will have disastrous effects on our farmers and growers — in addition to the burdensome costs passed down to consumers already battling soaring inflation,” said Clyde. “My home state of Georgia alone faces an unprecedented 14 percent one year increase, detrimentally harming our agricultural production and unquestionably benefitting foreign competitors. I strongly urge Secretary Walsh to put American farmers, rural communities, and consumers first by retracting the recommended wage raise hike for H-2A workers.” Organizations supporting the letter include: American Farm Bureau Federation, Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, Georgia Agribusiness Council, Georgia Farm Bureau, Indiana Farm Bureau, Michigan Farm Bureau, and South Carolina Farm Bureau. “The impact of a 14 percent wage increase in a single year for H-2A workers in Georgia will be devastating to Georgia’s farmers and will remove over $100 million from Georgia’s rural economy,” said Will Bentley, President of the Georgia Agribusiness Council. “This shock comes as farmers are already facing record high input costs and a much smaller share of the food dollar. If this increase stands, I’m afraid that you will see many farmers forced out of business and more food production shifted to Central and South America, away from the American Farmer.” Chris Butts, Vice President of the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, explained that Georgia farmers produce over 30 different fruit and vegetable commodities, and all require intensive hand labor. “Our only dependable labor source is through the H2-A program, but this excessive wage rate increase will only result in fewer jobs being offered in Georgia,” said Butts. “This increase will ultimately drive more jobs to our foreign competitors while making our country more reliant on foreign suppliers and harming our nation’s ability to feed itself. Rising wage rates are a reality that our growers expect and plan for but a 14 percent, one year increase is unsustainable. Drew Echols of Jaemor Farms in Georgia added: “A 14 percent wage rate increase is excessive and puts Georgia growers at a huge disadvantage to our foreign competitors who pay their workers less per day than we pay per hour. This is a massive hit to growers on top of inflation and record input costs that will ultimately harm our rural communities by driving agricultural production out of Georgia.” Republicans want to save the Family Farm Democrats want to destroy it!

JEAN-PIERRE: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome back from your Thanksgiving holiday. Hope everyone had a restful and wonderful holiday.
Okay, I’m going to be really quick at the top. As you see, we have a guest — as you know, we have a guest from National Security Council, John Kirby, with us today who’s going to take your questions ahead of the state visit. As you know, that will be happening on Thursday — our first state visit with France. And — first state visit, clearly, with — in this administration.
So, with that, I’m going to just start right away and turn it over to Kirby.
All right, John.
MR. KIRBY: Thank you so much, Karine.
Well, as Karine said, I’ve just got a couple of comments here at the top about the state visit. As the first state visit of the Biden-Harris administration, this is an opportunity to highlight a foundational component of this administration’s approach to foreign policy, and that’s through alliances.
France is a vital global partner and, of course, the United States’ oldest ally.
Our economic ties span established and cutting-edge sectors, with major investments in both directions supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in each country.
Our defense and security cooperation continues to expand and, of course, is vital to peace and stability all around the world.
Our partnership in tackling tough global challenges is underpinned by our shared commitment to democratic principles, values, and institutions.
And our cultural ties remain a source of strength and importance to our bilateral relationship. France remains, as you know, a top destination for many Americans and vice versa.
So, just briefly on the schedule breakdown: On Wednesday, President Macron will join Vice President Harris in visiting NASA headquarters to showcase our deepening collaboration on space, in support of Earth, climate, and space science and space exploration.
The bulk of the state visit events will take place on Thursday, starting with the official arrival ceremony. While then — while President Biden and President Macron conduct a bilateral discussion, there will be a separate program for the First Lady and Mrs. Macron.
In the afternoon, the Vice President and Secretary Blinken will host a luncheon at the State Department in honor of President and Mrs. Macron.
And then, of course, the visit culminates in the state dinner here at the White House that evening.
Throughout all of these events, you can expe- — you can expect to see on display both our long, shared history as allies, as well as our deep partnership in taking on the most urgent global challenges of today and tomorrow.
We anticipate that we’ll have more to share about the details of the state dinner and the guest list later this week.
While there are specific areas where we anticipate we’ll make progress during this visit, I want to stress that this visit really largely serves as a celebration of the strong footing of this relationship — one that is well rooted in our history from the very beginnings of our country, while also oriented squarely toward the future. And it’s a very dynamic, exciting future that we’re looking forward to.
With that, I’ll take some questions.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Andrea, do you want to go first?
Q Yeah. So, John, I wonder if you could just say a few words about why France was chosen for the first state visit. I know you sort of talked about the historic ties, but is this also, kind of, you know, a gesture in terms of making — making the relationship a little smoother after the AUKUS dust of last year?
MR. KIRBY: I kind of alluded to it in the answer, Andrea. A real — kind of a long pole in the tent for President Biden’s approach to foreign policy and to the world around us is the — is the strength and power of alliances. And our alliance is something that no other nation in the world can match — the network of American alliances. France is our oldest one.
And, I mean, if you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things. And President Macron has been a dynamic leader inside the G7, particularly there in Europe.
And so, the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.
Q Can I just follow up on that? One big issue that is dividing the U.S. and Europe at this moment is — are the EV credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q This is an issue — I mean, I realize the way the EU is structured — you know, the EU, Brussels, (inaudible) trade policy. Do you expect that issue to come up? Do you think there’s any chance of resolving that, short of a WTO, you know, dispute?
MR. KIRBY: I think, certainly, that the issue will most likely come up. I think we look forward to having that discussion with our French counterparts.
As you know, last month, the United States stood up — helped stood up — stand up an EU-U.S. IRA taskforce, just last month, to try to make sure that we can better understand the concerns of our European friends about this and so many other issues.
The bottom line for us is, first of all, we want to understand the concerns. We’re absolutely willing to have that conversation and to find a way to work through those issues of concern. But it’s not a zero-sum game. I mean, clean energy — that’s a tide that raises all boats, the more we can transition to a clean energy economy around the world. And there’s plenty of opportunity for everybody in that.
So we’re looking forward to having those discussions.
Q Thanks, Karine and John. On a different topic, I was hoping — what is the White House’s message, the President’s message to people in China who are peaceably protesting COVID lockdowns there? And then, did the topic of China’s zero-COVID policy come up in the President’s bilateral meeting with President Xi when they met in Indonesia a couple weeks ago?
MR. KIRBY: They did talk about COVID and the effect that the pandemic had had around the world. Clearly, that came up inside the conversation. I don’t know if, specifically, the zero-COVID policy was an issue of discussion, but certainly COVID was on the agenda, as you might expect that it would be.
And our message to peaceful protesters around the world is the same and consistent: People should be allowed the right to assemble and to peacefully protest policies or laws or dictates that they take issue with.
Q Does the White House support their efforts to sort of regain personal freedoms in light of these lockdowns?
MR. KIRBY: The White House supports the right of peaceful protest.
Q And then, on a different topic, the State Department announced today that Russia abruptly canceled the latest rounds of arms negotiations.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q Is the present plan to reach out to anybody about that? Is there any White House reaction to that?
MR. KIRBY: I don’t have any phone calls or conversations to read out. What you’re talking about is the Bilateral Consultative Commission. And this is a component of the New START Treaty that was signed on to in 2010. This is a — it’s basically an opportunity for both sides to get together and talk about the technicalities, the formalities, the compliance mechanisms that are in place with respect to New START.
This would have been the first one that we would have put in place since COVID, which obviously prevented those kinds of face-to-face meetings, so we very much were looking forward to starting. It was supposed to start tomorrow. And we were very much looking forward to that because we continue to believe in the importance of New START.
We haven’t got — haven’t received, excuse me, a real solid answer from the Russians as to why they postponed this. We’re going to be working through the embassy to try to figure out what happened here. And we’d like to see it get back on the schedule as soon as possible, because it’s important. It’s not just important for our two nations. It’s important for the rest of the world.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay, we’re going to go the back. The gentleman in the back. Go ahead.
Q Thank you, Karine. Two questions, John. First, the niece of the Ayatollah Khamenei was arrested in Tehran recently as part of the protest mark. Does the administration, having stated its support for peaceful protests, have any particular statement about her arrest?
MR. KIRBY: We would, I think, say — stay very consistent, sir, that we believe in the right of peaceful protest. We have made it clear that we stand with particularly — it’s largely Iranian women, but it’s obviously beyond that — but particularly their concerns about the dictates that have affected their lives personally.
And we will continue to do whatever we can to not only support their right of protest but to hold the regime accountable for the way it’s treating its people.
Q And along the same lines, is the administration going to put out a statement to the military junta in Burma about the published reports of the incarceration and keeping incommunicado the former leader Aung San Suu Kyi?
MR. KIRBY: I don’t have a preview of some sort of statement to read out to you today. We’ve been very clear about our concerns over — over the military’s domination there and their practice and their policies, particularly the way they treat political prisoners. But I don’t have a statement for you today about that particular issue.
Q On China, John, is it the U.S.’s assessment that these protests we’ve seen are widespread? Or are they perhaps more isolated incidents that are being amplified by social media?
MR. KIRBY: I don’t think that we know a whole lot more about the geographic location, size, scale, and scope of them than what you’re learning as well through social media and through traditional media. It’s not like we have, I think,a finer sense of insight than what’s already out there in the public sphere. So I — you know, I don’t — I don’t have a sense of that.
Q In that realm, the statement you issued — or that wasissued earlier today didn’t include any explicit calls for China to stop detaining and harming protesters and journalists. Why not?
MR. KIRBY: We’re watching this closely, as you might expect we would. And again, we continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest.
And I think we’re going to watch this closely, and we’ll see where things go.
Q Can I ask you a quick one on Iran?
MR. KIRBY: Sure.
Q The U.S. Men’s National Soccer Team —
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
— had thrown up an image of the old flag before them, including the Islamic Republic symbol.
MR. KIRBY: That’s right.
Q Was the — does the White House have any comment on that decision?
MR. KIRBY: No, actually, we don’t. And this isn’t the kind of thing that you would — that the White House would comment on.
USA Soccer is a private entity, and they — they make their own decisions about those kinds of things. And we wouldn’t — we wouldn’t comment on that. We wish them all the best tomorrow.
Q The team had said it was cons- — it changed the flag after consultations with various entities afterward. Are you aware of anyone in the U.S. government speaking to the team about —
MR. KIRBY: I am not aware of any conversations by anybody in the U.S. government that had anything to do with their decision either to post that image previously and then to take it down and replace it, no.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: JJ.
Q On China, again, John, is it the U.S.’s — is it the U.S.’s assessment that there’s any sort of risk to the U.S. economy or the U.S. supply chain because of the protests?
MR. KIRBY: We don’t see any particular impact right now to the supply chain as a result of these protests.
Q And then, on the vaccines: Has the U.S. offered any U.S.-made vaccines — coronavirus vaccines — to China — the mRNA vaccines?
MR. KIRBY: We have not offered any to China at this time. As you know, we are the largest supplier of COVID vaccines around the world. And we have not received any requests or any interest by China to receive our vaccines.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sebastian.
Q Thank you very much. Thank you, John. Again, on China. You had just noted that you’re watching this closely, as we might expect. Could you give us a sense of how much the President is engaging with this issue? Is he watching it personally, you know, getting updated more than on, maybe, some other things?
MR. KIRBY: The President is staying briefed on what’s going on inside China. Yes.
Q Is it fair to say he’s “closely” briefed on this?
MR. KIRBY: Any time — (laughter) —
Q Just — just trying to get an impression of, like, where he’s at with this issue.
MR. KIRBY: I’ve never been in the room where he wasn’t, like, closely briefed. I mean, yeah, he’s — he’s — he’s staying atop on what’s — what’s going on. He’s monitoring this. We all are.
So, yes, the President is certainly staying mindful of the protest activity.
Q Okay. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Alex, way in the back.
Q Thanks, Karine. Thank you, John. You know, I sort of assume that the United States supports peaceful protest around the world. That, with all due respect, doesn’t strike, I would think, most people as a novel position.
The question is —
MR. KIRBY: Well, I’m glad that it’s not a novel position. It’s exactly where we should be.
Q But the President has explicitly drawn a contrast between autocracy and democracy here and also abroad. Isn’t this a moment — obviously, without getting into some sort of grand conflict — to sort of assert the rights of people, advocating for freedom and democracy more forcefully than perhaps we have?
MR. KIRBY: This is, I think, a moment to reassert what we believe in when it comes to free assembly and — and peaceful protest. And we’ve done that and will continue to do that, whether it’s people protesting in Iran or China or anywhere else around the world.
Nothing has changed about the President’s firm belief in the power of democracy and democratic institutions and how important that is. But this is really a moment — to put it back into your words — this is a moment for — you know, for the — for the Chinese people and the Chinese government to speak to.
We have been nothing but clear and consistent, and I think you’ll see that going forward.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Peter and then Mary.
Q So, just to follow up, John: On the China issue, why is the White House’s line that “everybody has the right to peacefully protest” and not “the U.S. thinks it’s bad to lock people up in their houses to stop COVID”?
MR. KIRBY: We’ve — we’ve made it clear, Peter, that a lockdown is not a policy that we’re going to support here. We’ve — we’ve come a long way over these last three years — hard to believe three years — in terms of treating COVID and preventing COVID.
So we’ve said, you know, a lockdown is not a policy that we support here. But, obviously, there are people in China that — that have — have concerns about that. And they’re protesting that, and we believe they should be able to do that peacefully.
Q Okay. And on the sanctions relief for Venezuela —
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q — why is it that President Biden would rather let U.S. companies drill for oil in Venezuela than here in the U.S.?
MR. KIRBY: That’s not an accurate take on the President’s view.
Q Earlier this month, he said, “No more drilling. There is no more drilling.”
MR. KIRBY: The President has issued 9,000 permits for drilling on U.S. federal lands, Peter; 9,000 of them are being unused. There are plenty of opportunities for oil and gas companies to drill here in the United States.
Now, I’ll let Chevron speak for this particular issue of sanctions relief, but our expectation is it won’t be a lot of oil coming out of there. It will have to be shipped to the United States.
Q Does the President think there’s some benefit to the climate to drill oil in Venezuela and not here?
MR. KIRBY: No, it has nothing to do with a benefit to the climate, Peter. Again, there are 9,000 unused permits here in the United States on federal land that oil and gas companies can and should take advantage of. Nine thousand. And we’re talking about one there in Venezuela.
Now, look, it remains to be seen how much will get drilled down there. It’ll be up to Chevron to decide that, Peter. But — but as a function of the sanction itself, that oil, whatever product is drilled, has to come to the United States.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Mary.
Q One more on China. How concerned is the President that China’s zero-COVID strategy and that these restrictions may be inhibiting the economic recovery globally and here at home?
MR. KIRBY: The President believes — and he’s said this many times — I mean, COVID absolutely has had an impact on the global economy. Certainly, it’s had an impact on supply chains and resources around the world. And that’s why the President wants to move the United States as quickly and as efficiently as we can through COVID so that — so that even our economy can get more on track than it already is becoming now.
So, I mean, it is having a global effect. But what is also having a very acute, significant global impact on the economy is the war in Ukraine. And that’s why we’re trying to go after a price cap on Russian oil. That’s why we’re trying to give Ukraine the tools and capabilities they need to succeed on the battlefield so this — this war can end, can end in a way in which Ukraine can be whole and sovereign and free.
So there’s a — there’s a lot of impacts on the global economy; it’s not just about COVID.
Q But beyond just COVID generally, I mean, does he think that China’s zero-COVID strategy — that these restrictions are inhibiting the economic recovery?
MR. KIRBY: The President recognizes that in many countries around the world, COVID is still an issue. And certainly, to the degree that it inhibits a country’s ability to conduct commerce, it’s having an impact on the world. And China is a huge economic competitor out there.
But I wouldn’t get into parsing the dollar-figure effect here of the remaining challenge of COVID in China. But clearly, China as a major economic player and China still struggling with COVID, there’s — obviously there’s an impact on the economy.
Q And just one more. On Paul Whelan, his brother said he missed a scheduled phone call home to his family on Thursday, which they say is incredibly unusual for him to miss a call, especially on a holiday like that. How concerned are you about this silence? Have you received any information on his condition? And just, can you give us any update on any progress that may or may not have been made?
MR. KIRBY: I’m afraid I don’t have an update for you. This is the first I’ve heard that there was a phone call that was missed. So why don’t you let me take that back and see if we can find out something for you? I don’t want to just speculate up here.
Obviously, we’re deeply concerned about him and — and Brittney Griner and all Americans wrongfully detained overseas. But let me take that question.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All done, Mary? Okay. Go ahead, Phil.
Q Thank you. Two quick questions. One on China and then on Ukraine. I’m wondering, what is the President’s reaction when he hears protesters in China chant “freedom” or “Xi Jinping step down”?
MR. KIRBY: The President is not going to speak for protesters around the world; they’re speaking for themselves.
Q And so there’s no reaction?
MR. KIRBY: These protesters are speaking for themselves. What we are doing is making it clear that we support the right of peaceful protest.
Q And then, my follow-up: Is the backlog of arms shipments to Taiwan a result of our stepped-up efforts to send arms to Ukraine?
MR. KIRBY: What I can tell you is that we are constantly balancing, as we must, our own inventories, the inventories of our allies and partners and people that we do conduct arm sales with, as well as, of course, the inventory that the Ukrainian armed forces need to fight the Russian aggression.
And it’s a balancing act. And with every single decision by the President to draw down DOD stocks, you know, he gets an assessment from the Pentagon about whether that’s going to affect our readiness. And we’re in constant touch with, again, allies and partners about their readiness needs, because many of them are reliant on U.S. systems. And of course, you know, that includes Taiwan.
We just — the President just signed out — what, a month or so ago? — another billion dollars of Taiwan arm sales. And of course, we’re going to continue to look at what the next iteration of that needs to look like and when that would occur. But we take very seriously our responsibility to help provide Taiwan the self-defense capabilities that — that it needs. That’s in accordance with law and policy, and that’s not going to change.
Q But in terms of those shipments actually going out the door to Taiwan currently, is there a backlog when it comes to those arms being shipped?
MR. KIRBY: I’m not going to get into it at a public podium, talking about inventory stocks of any system anywhere. That just is not a good idea for — for us to do. Certainly not from the podium.
We — we watch it very closely. We make sure that our readiness can be preserved, as well as the readiness of our allies and partners.
But look, has — has all the provisions to Ukraine — has that — has that caused an effort inside the administration to make sure that we are — that we are judiciously monitoring stocks and inventories, and working with the defense industry to plus them up and to make sure that those supply chains are still flowing? Absolutely. They — of course — of course we are. But it’s a balance we strike every day.
Q Thank you, sir.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, way in the back there.
Q Thanks. John, regarding Turkey, many are skeptical regarding the Turkish claims that the PKK was behind the explosion in Istanbul. And now they are using this as a justification for a ground operation in Syria.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q Did the U.S. ask for evidence, or did you offer help for the investigation? Do you see this as a proper justification for a ground operation in Syria?
MR. KIRBY: I don’t believe we’ve — we’re — offered anything to help with the investigation. And we’re not in a position to — to say specifically who was responsible. We condemned the violence at the time. We condemn it today.
And as I’ve said as recently as a week or so ago, we do need to remember that Turkey continues to be — to fall victim to terrorist attacks, whether it’s near that border or elsewhere inside the country. And they have a right to — to defend themselves and their citizens against attacks.
Now, what we’ve said additionally is that we want to see the tensions de-escalate here. And we don’t want to see any actions that, A, lead to the potential of additional casualties, particularly civilian casualties. And, B, do anything that would harm our efforts to continue to work with our Syrian counterparts against ISIS, which remains a viable, credible threat inside Iraq and Syria, and we got to keep the pressure on them.
Q But is this a greenlight for Erdoğan to go inside Syria when you say they — they have the right to defend themselves?
MR. KIRBY: They do have the right to defend themselves. They had — they have — they have suffered terrorist attacks.
But we don’t want to see actions, particularly inside Syria, that are going to lead to a potential for more casualties, more loss of innocent life, and any diminution of our efforts — distraction away from our efforts, because we have troops in Syria that — to go after — to ISIS.
The other thing I would — I’d mentioned is we also don’t want to see any actions inside Syria, by Turkey or anyone else, that could put American lives at risk, because there are Americans on the ground, and they’re helping the SDF.
Q Thanks, John. There were some concrete steps moving the relationship forward, in terms of a bilateral basis, after the meeting between President Biden and Xi.
MR. KIRBY: Right.
Q Is there any concern or will that — those steps have any effect on how the U.S. responds to any Chinese response to the protests that are currently ongoing?
MR. KIRBY: I think we’re going to have to watch this going forward, Phil. What I can tell you is: As you and I are talking today, there’s — there’s been no change to our desire to continue to see these channels of communication stay open. And we were heartened coming away from the G20 that both leaders were able to agree on getting some of these working-level discussions back open.
And so, we’re still in that mode, Phil, where we want to continue to get those — get those discussions back up in play.
And as for whether or not there’ll be an impact from the protests, we’re just going to have to — I think we’re just — as I said, we’re going to watch this and see where it goes.
Q One more quick one. Apologies, Karine. We’re kind of in crunch time for the price cap you mentioned a few minutes ago.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah.
Q Is there a sense inside the White House right now that the President or the team will need to have more of a public posture in terms of trying to get this across the finish line? I know it’s kind of an EU-level issue right now, but —
MR. KIRBY: Yeah, I don’t think — Phil, I don’t think we’re at that point right now where we feel there’s some sort of inordinate pressure to — to be more public about it than we already have been. I think we’ve been very public about it. Or that, you know — you know, we need to smash down on the accelerator here.
The discussions are going well, we think. And we strongly believe that a price cap is a good approach, the right approach to limit Mr. Putin’s ability to profiteer off this war. And our EU colleagues are working through the modalities of it right now: how that would be implemented, what level it’s going to be at.
We think those discussions are going on in a pretty robust fashion, so I don’t think we believe there’s a pressure on us right now to get more involved than we already are.
Q Thanks, John.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Steve.
Q Thanks. John, I want to try to get your response to a letter that was sent by the leadership of five news organizations to the administration.
One of those news organizations is the New York Times. These organizations worked with Julian Assange prior to the publication of classified cables by WikiLeaks, and they’re asking that the administration drop the Espionage Act charge that was put forward against Assange by the Trump administration.
Generally, what’s the White House’s response to that request? And I’ll start there, and then I’ll ask you a follow-up.
MR. KIRBY: Yeah, we’re aware of it, and we would refer you to the Justice Department
Q All right, I anticipated that answer. What is your assessment or what is the National Security Council’s assessment of the harm that was done by the WikiLeaks leak in 2012? That would inform any decision by the Justice Department.
MR. KIRBY: I think, you know, we — if you go back and look at how the administration responded in 2012 — and, of course, President Biden was then Vice President at the time — we would — we would maintain that we — that what — what we said at the time — what was said at the time, that those — that those leaks, those revelations in the public sphere were damaging to U.S. national security.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Inaudible.)
Q Yeah, I just wanted to ask: The head of NATO is warning that, essentially, Vladimir Putin is using winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine. What specifically is the United States doing in conjunction with its partners and allies to counter that, given the continued attacks on the energy grid?
MR. KIRBY: So, you’re referring to the — his targeting of civilian infrastructure? Yeah.
So, I mean, this is a guy who’s used food as a weapon. He’s used fear as a weapon. He — and as — as our — as the Secretary-General of NATO said, now he’s using the coming cold weather here to basically try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees.
When you take a look at what he’s hitting, it’s almost all civilian infrastructure. And it’s largely — as you pointed out — it’s energy, it’s water, it’s the kind of resources that people need as they get ready to brace for what will no doubt be a cold winter.
And so, what we’re doing is a couple of things. First of all, we’re still going to continue to provide the Ukrainian armed forces with the tools, weapons, the capabilities, the training that they need so that they can be successful on the battlefield. And they have been very successful in just the last few weeks.
Secondly, we’re working with allies and partners around the world — and certainly working inside the various agencies of this administration — to get spare parts, equipment, transformers, the kinds of material they’ll need to get some of these systems and networks back up and running and get the power turned back on in much of Ukraine — as well as, of course, water resources. So, we’re working on that very, very hard — again, with allies and partners.
It’s — some of the material will no doubt come from the United States. But we also recognize that their grid is based on infrastructure that is uniquely European. And so, we’re going to — we’re working with, again, allies and partners in the region as well to see what they can do to get — to get more in there to keep the lights on and the water running.
But it’s despicable. It’s absolutely despicable what he is doing in these last few weeks. Not that he hasn’t been despicable before, but you — you hit exactly on the issue, that these targets are largely civilian. And it’s designed to want — for one reason, and that’s to try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees, because he can’t bring the Ukrainian armed forces to its knees.
And you would think that now — going into, I guess it’s eight months now, which is hard to believe — actually going into our ninth month here — that he would have learned — he, Putin, would have learned a while ago that you just can’t bring the Ukrainian people to their knees.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Two more. Go ahead.
Q Kim Jong Un says he is trying to build the most powerful nuclear force. Do you expect the North Koreans to conduct a nuclear test in the near future?
MR. KIRBY: We’ve said that we believe Kim could conduct a nuclear test at any time.
Q Okay. One more. His daughter made a public appearance twice this month. What do you think about her appearance? Why suddenly now?
MR. KIRBY: I certainly can’t speak to the parenting skills of Kim Jong Un. I’m afraid I don’t have anything for you there. (Laughter.)
Look, in all seriousness, the man continues to advance military capabilities that continue to destabilize the region — not just the Peninsula but the region. And we’re taking this seriously, which is why we’re improving our intelligence capabilities there, collection capabilities in the region.
It’s why we’re working so hard with Japan and South Korea bilaterally and trilaterally. The President had a chance to meet with both leaders while we were at the G20 to advance our own defense capabilities and our own defense needs.
People sometimes forget and I’ve said it a lot; you guys probably roll your eyes when I say this because I’ve said it before, but five of our seven treaty alliances, because since we — since we started the briefing talking about alliances — five of seven are in the Indo-Pacific, and we take them seriously because they put on us very significant security commitments to help with the defense of Japan and South Korea, respectively, in this case. And we take that seriously, which means we got to make sure we’re ready for the kinds of capabilities that he clearly is so interested in continuing to pursue.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Gerren. And then, Monica, you’ll have the last question.
Q Thanks, Karine. Thanks, John. There have been reports about the penal colony that Brittney Griner is being held, indicating that she potentially is exposed to forced labor and homophobia and racism. Is there any update about her physical and mental health?
And I know CIA Director Burns did meet with his counterpart in Russia. Are there any plans to have another meeting between officials, between U.S. and Russia, to specifically discuss this ongoing negotiation to get her home?
MR. KIRBY: Great questions, both of them. On the — on the second one, we continue to have ongoing conversations with Russian officials about Brittney’s release, as well as Mr. Whelan’s, in trying to get them home to their families where they belong. I can assure you that those conversations are ongoing, and we want them both home as fast as possible, and this administration is going to stay committed to that task.
On her condition, I think you can understand, for — for privacy reasons, I’m not going to get into much detail about her physical health. I wouldn’t do that. I can just tell you that we’re taking that very seriously as well, knowing where she is and what penal colonies are designed to do. And we’re making — we’re trying to make sure we have as much access and information about her condition as possible. Sometimes that’s done more through her representatives than it is from our diplomatic presence just because of the modalities of it. But we’re doing the best we can to stay on top of it as much as we can.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Monica, last question.
Q John, can you share any update on whether President Biden will accept the invitation of Mexican President López Obrador to attend the “Three Amigos” summit in Mexico City? I know that had been talked about as potentially scheduled for December. It now may be pushed back to January. Is there anything you can share on that?
MR. KIRBY: The North American Leaders’ Summit? Yeah. The President is looking forward to being able to have — to have that meeting. But we don’t have a date yet or anything to say on the schedule. Nothing to confirm on the schedule right now. But he’s looking forward to the discussion, absolutely.
All right.
Q Thanks, John.
MR. KIRBY: Thanks, guys. Happy late Thanksgiving toyou.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks, John.
Okay, before we dive into questions, just, I have a couple things — a few updates at the top to share with all of you.
As you know, President Biden committed to doing everything within his power to address Putin’s price hike at the pump.
Today, gas prices have returned to the levels they were prior to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. As the chart behind me shows, the national average is $3.55 per gallon down over $1.45 per gallon from the June peak. The most common price is $2.99 per gallon. That’s saving American families with two cars about $160 per month, on average.
This is important breathing room for American families and meets a key commitment that the President made to them. So, it’s no accident either — on a couple of things. President Biden has been releasing oil from the reserve, as you know, which was a historic action that this President took. He called on international partners to release oil as well. And he’s been calling on oil and gas companies to pass on their savings to consumers at the pump. The President’s actions have helped bring prices down for families, and he will continue to do everything possible to bring prices down even further.
Earlier today, the President signed a Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence to strengthen the U.S. government’s effort to combat rape as a weapon of war.
This Presidential Memorandum directs the State Department, Treasury Department, and other federal agency to leverage sanctions authorities, assistance restrictions, and other tools to promote accountability for perpetrators of conflict-related sexual violence.
With this executive action, U.S. departments and agency are for the first time ever being directed to ensure equal consideration of acts of conflict-related sexual violence when identifying targets and preparing designations for potential sanctions.
Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States will continue leading efforts to rally other nations and international organizations to prevent and promote accountability for acts of conflict-related sexual violence.
Today’s action is part of the President’s broader commitment to work to address all forms of gender-based violence.
Now, finally, today, President Biden met with three U.S. winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize: Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Dr. John Clauser, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics; and Dr. Douglas Diamond, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.
The President is restarting an important tradition that just like — just like he does for winning sports teams, as you have seen him do in the past 20 months or so, the President meets with U.S. winners of the Nobel Prize.
Their achievements show how taking on the biggest questions can establish new fields of inquiry, promote technology, innovation, and expand the boundaries of what is possible. Their work is a reminder of why the President often says that the — America can be defined by one word, and you all know that word that he uses is “possibilities.”
With that, I’m going to go out of school for a second. And I know there’s a young reporter in the room who would like to ask a question. Eva? Eva Shapiro?
Q Shapiro.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sha- — oh, pardon me. And where are you from? What —
Q Austin, Texas.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Austin, Texas. And you are part of the Kid’s Scoop —
Q KidScoop Media.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Well, welcome to the briefing room. It’s great to have you. And you could — you’re going to trump AP. And — (laughs) — I’ll take your first question.
Q Given the situation in Iran with protesting, what are we going to do or what can we do to help?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, that’s an excellent question and an important question to ask. And we have answered this question multiple times here at the at this podium, and the President spoke to this when he was in the — in the halls of the United Nations not too long ago in September. And he said, “We stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.” End quote.
There’s a lot that we can do and a lot that we are doing to support those brave citizens, again, of Iran — those brave protesters. We’re taking steps both on our own, as the United States, and also in partnership with other countries just around the world, and including organizations like the United Nations, as I mentioned, when the President first made his comments about what we were seeing in Iran from the civilians.
But let me just give you a couple of examples. We’re using economic tools like sanctions against Iranian officials. We supported the U.N. Human Rights Council’s vote to create a fact-finding mission to investigate human rights abuses in Iran, which — which was really historic, something that we had not seen.
So, we’re working with civil society organizations to make sure Iran is removed from a United Nations body focused on women, called the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. We have expressed support for the Joint Statement by Women Foreign Ministers on Iran. And we’re speaking out over and over again, and raising awareness and making sure that those brave women and citizens are lifted up as they are really fighting for their basic rights.
But thank you so much for your question. I really appreciate you. And again, welcome — welcome to the briefing room. Hopefully you come back.
All right. Go ahead.
Q Thanks, Karine. And welcome to the briefing room. On — two and a half weeks ago, when the President held his press conference after the midterm results, he said he’d be inviting congressional leadership of both parties over to the White House after his trip to the G20. We’re a week-plus since he’s been back. Has that invite gone out? And when is that meeting going to take place?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, Congress has just returned, so the President is looking forward to talking to, speaking with — to Democratic and Republican leadership. I don’t have anything to preview for you at this time on a date on when that will happen. But he is — this is something that he is indeed looking forward to, and we will make that happen as soon as we can.
Q Today is this deadline for counties to certify election results in a number of states, including Arizona, where at least one county has refused to certify the results of the midterm elections from a couple weeks ago, citing the conduct of the election in another county, in Maricopa County. Does the White House — is the White House monitoring, sort of, state-level and local- and county-level efforts to, sort of, overturn election results or not certify election results? And does the President have any response?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the — very good question. I don’t have anything to share on if we’re monitoring anything specific or in particular. I’m sure that’s something the DNC is doing, and other committees are clearly focusing on on those particulars very closely.
Look —
Q (Inaudible.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. No, but I — we’ve been very clear on the sacred right to vote and how — you know, and how it’s important that the American people feel like their vote will be counted.
And that — and he has denounced the election deniers that we have heard from on the other side, and he has called that out, and he has every confidence in our electoral system.
Q And then, just lastly, we know those rail negotiations are — seem to be nearing impasse. There’s a report in the Washington Post that the President plans to ask Congress to step in and either extend the cooling-off period for talks or take some other measures to try to prevent a potentially devastating shutdown of the rail system in the next couple of weeks.
Does — can you confirm that the President does plan to ask Congress to step in and take action here?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I don’t have anything right now at this time to announce or preview on any announcement that the President is going to make. Once he is ready to make that announcement, certainly, he — we will let you know — or make an announcement of any kind related to this, we will clearly share that with all of you.
I do want to say a couple of things, which is really important as we look at what’s currently happening. Look, from the beginning, the President has been very clear: A shutdown is unacceptable because of the impact that it would have on jobs and families and farms and businesses and communities just across the country.
The President is directly involved in the process and has been engaged with his team and also has had conversation with members of Congress on this particular issue in case — in case resolving the issue — in case resolving the issue falls to them, as it has 18 times in the last 60 years, as you know. I know you guys are following this closely.
And in addition — in addition to the President’s involvement, Secretary Walsh has been in contact with rail workers, the unions there. He has been in direct connection — contact with them. Secretary Buttigieg has been in contact with rail companies. And Secretary Vilsack has engaged agriculture and industry stakeholders as well.
So, this has been very much not just the President but, clearly, the three Secretaries that I just mentioned in his administration.
A majority of unions, as you all know, have voted to ratify the — the temporary agreement. That’s 8 out of 12. There are 12 unions involved. And the best option that we believe, that the President believes, is still for the parties to resolve these themselves, res- — resolve this themselves and to do this, really, in short order.
Q Members of the Democratic National Committee are meeting here in Washington later this week to talk about the potential calendar for the party’s presidential nomination process in 2024. They’re doing this, in essence, at the behest of the President, who has signaled that he’s not a huge fan of Iowa going first, given the lack of diversity in that state.
Can you say whether he intends to weigh in on this issue as or before they meet, or if he indeed believes that Iowa should lose its first-in-the-nation status?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, this is not something that I’m going to speak to from here. This is something that the Democratic National Committee, as you know, is — that committee that you’re speaking of is out of the DNC. And so, I would refer you to them specifically.
I don’t have anything else to preview or to share about any comments or statements that the President may make on this particular issue.
But again, from here, I’m not going to comment from — on this. I would refer you to the — to the DNC.
Q Are there any plans for the President to go to Georgia in the final days of the Senate runoff?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I’ve been asked this question before about what the President is — could potentially be doing for the Georgia runoff. I have to be careful because it is an existing — existing race that is happening. And so, I cannot — I am covered by the Hatch Act, so I can’t speak specifically to this.
But what I can say, and I’ve said this before: The President is willing to do whatever is needed of him by Senator Warnock. I don’t have anything else to preview from here.
Q So does that mean that the ask hasn’t been made from Senator Warnock (inaudible)?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I really — I just — I don’t want to dive into request or asks. That’s something that we didn’t do during the midterms the past several months. We’re certainly not going to start now.
What I can say: I don’t have anything to preview for you at this time or to announce. But again, the President is willing to do whatever is asked of him.
Q The Boston Globe is reporting that the President is going to be in Boston on Friday for a fundraiser. Can you confirm that trip? And then, also, they note that that day the Royals will be in Boston as well for the Earthshot Prize. Is there potentially going to be an overlap or meeting? Or will the President —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I heard about that. This is the — the Prince of Wales is going to be — so — (laughter) — I don’t have anything to share on the President’s travels for — any traveling announcement to make for Friday or any — any future date after tomorrow. As you all know, he’ll be going to Michigan.
Once we have something to share, certainly, we will share that. And as far as the — the Royals being in town, I don’t have anything to preview as well.
Q Finally, the President said he did a part of his annual physical while he was talking about — answering a question about this specifically in Nantucket. And he said he would do the rest before the end of the year. What did he mean by that? And then will be — he be going to Walter Reed, as he did last year in the next couple of weeks?MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So that’s a good question. I haven’t — I actually have not talked to him about that. I remember him saying that over the weekend.
Look, I was asked this question just at the last briefing. You know, the President is in good health and maintains an active lifestyle. You see him on a — almost on a regular basis yourselves. And you can see — he always says, “Watch me.”
He will have a physical in the upcoming months. And the results will be, certainly, released, as — the same way as it was last year, in a very transparent way. And we will be sharing with — that with all of you as soon as — as soon as we have it.
Go ahead, Steven.
Q Thanks. Just to go back to the rail labor dispute. What would drive the President to seek a congressional resolution here?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I’m not going to legislate from here. What I can say is we have been in regular communication with Congress for the past several months. But certainly not going to legislate or — or lay out the process from here.
Q Let me ask you this: In 1992, the last time Congress intervened to prevent a labor rail shutdown, Joe Biden was one of six senators, and only six, to say that the Congress should not intervene, that it’s a dynamic that favors the railroads against the interests of the workers. Why would he seek congressional intervention now?MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, again, I can’t — I’m — when the President has made a decision on this, if he makes a decision on this, you’ll hear directly from him. Don’t have anything to share or preview at this time.
As I mentioned moments ago, the President has been in regular contact with members of Congress. He has been directly involved in having those conversations, directly involved with his administration. I laid out what Secretary Walsh is doing, what Secretary Buttigieg and Secretary Vilsack —
This is something that has been a priority for this President and this administration for the past several months. Majority — as I just laid out, also, moments ago — of unions have ratified the tentative agreement.
Again, I’m not going to legislate from here, not going to get into — get ahead of any potential announcement. But as you stated, in cases like this, issues falls to Congress. And it has done this 18 times in the last 60 years.
So, again, it’s not unusual, but I’m just not going to get into a hypothetical from here at this time.
Go ahead.
Q A couple questions about the lame duck agenda. The President said last week that he was going to try to ban assault weapons during the session. What does that look like? Is he making calls? Is he taking meetings on this? Has he tasked the team with working on this? And does he think that 60 votes are actually possible here, that’s within reach somehow?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I’m so glad you asked the question, Mary, because this morning, when I was in the Oval Office in a meeting with the President, he actually brought this up himself, because he knows how his comments were reported over the weekend. And he wanted to be very clear, and he said that, you know, he believes that it’s important to keep this issue — in banning assault weapons — at the front of minds of Americans.
He believes that it is — it is — it is also up to him, as President of the United States, to make the case for why it is critical to move forward with assault — assault weapons ban.
And so he — he — look, he understands what’s at stake. He wants the American people to continue to understand what’s at stake. We know many communities have felt this very deeply, very personally.
And he also believes — you know, there were families this past — this past Thanksgiving holiday who looked around their table and they were missing members of their family because of this gun violence, this horrific gun violence that we have seen as recently as this weekend, as recently as just last week. And he believes that they deserve — they deserve to — for us, for him, to continue to talk about this, continue to put this out there about the importance of getting this done for American communities.
But again, look, we understand it’s an uphill battle. We understand that this is not easy. He gets that. But it doesn’t mean that he’s going to stop fighting for it or that he’s going to stop talking about it.
Q And on one other issue, raising the debt ceiling: We’ve seen Republicans who have threatened to use this as leverage to get some of their agenda items through. How much importance does the President placed on raising the debt ceiling during a lame duck session?MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, you know, we’ve been clear about this: When it comes to the debt ceiling, it should not — it should not be used — or never be a matter of political brinksmanship. We’ve been very clear about that.
And congr- — you know, congressional Republicans, they passed this with the last President three times — the former President. They — they passed to lift the debt ceiling three times. There’s no reason why this should not be happening this time around.
The Congress, you know, needs to take the responsibility, once again, to address the debt ceiling before it expires. And they need to act sooner rather than later.
Look, now that Congress is back, we believe that, you know, there will be more of an urgency to get this done.
And look, this is — this is about, you know, the sooner they act — you know, this is about our economy. This will be better for our economy. So we’re — have those conversation.
The President, as I was asked moments ago, is going to meet with leadership from both the Hou- — from both the House and the Senate, the Democratic and Republican leadership. And certainly we’ll be having these conversations.
Q You just laid out for us the gas price — that prices are back down to levels before the war. Housing prices, on the other hand, are not coming down nearly fast enough. Given the split Congress — you know, we’ve talked about some of the difficulty of the lame-duck session — I mean, have you run out of options in terms of pressing down housing prices? And what can you do to help people there, especially if the student debt issue doesn’t, you know, go your way?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, we are — as the President said, to your — to your last statement about the student debt relief, his relief plan — he’s optimistic. He’s an optimistic person. He’s going to continue to fight for a plan that’s going to help close to 40 million Americans across the country. And let’s not forget 90 percent of them are making less than $75,000 a year. That matters. That is a plan that is going to give people a little bit of breathing room.
So we are — we are confident in our — in our — in our legal standing, if you will. As you know, it’s up — it’s up to the Supreme Court, and we’re going to continue to fight. That will not end.
But to your question: Look, affor- — housing affordability is a central challenge for families; we know that — as you just laid that out, Andrea. And that’s due to longstanding shortfall of affordable housing, plus increased demand for homes during the pandemic and a reduced number of homes due to previous supply chain challenges.
So the good news is this: that we are starting to see the housing market cool by a range of measures just a bit. Several data sources now show that rent falling are — or rent growth easing in recent months, which should mean lower shelter inflation on months ahead.
And — but we understand, and we get it. As I just said, it’s a central issue for many families and many Americans. There’s more work to do. And we will continue to — to use all of the administrative tools to make sure that we give — we continue to give families some relief.
Q Just a question about Twitter. You know, there’s a researcher at Stanford who says that this is a critical moment, really, in terms of ensuring that Twitter does not become a vector for misinformation. I mean, are you concerned about the — you know, Elon Musk says there’s more and more subscribers coming online. Are you concerned about that? And what tools do you have? Who is it at the White House that is really keeping track of this?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, this is something that we’re certainly keeping an eye on. And, look, we — you know, we have always been very clear and — that when it comes to social media platforms, it is their responsibility to make sure that when it comes to misinformation, when we — when it comes to the hate that we’re seeing, that they take action, that they continue to take action.
Again, we’re all keeping a close eye on this. We’re all monitoring what’s — what’s currently occurring. And we see — you know, we see it with our own eyes of what you all are reporting and, just for ourselves, what’s happening on Twitter.
But again, social media companies have a responsibility to prevent their platforms from being used by any user to incite violence, especially violence directed at individual communities, as we have been seeing. And the President has been very clear on calling that out. He’ll continue to do that. And we’re going to continue to monitor the situation.
Go ahead, Phil.
Q Thanks, Karine. I don’t think the President has spoken to the House Republican leader since the day after the election, even though the House was called for Republicans a few days later. Does that have anything to do with the fact that he may not actually be Speaker of the House next Congress? Or how are you guys kind of working through that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, no, I — that — I mean, Congress has been out. They’re just coming back in.
Look, the President has been really clear, and he’s underscored this many times, that he’s here to find common ground and work across the aisle. That is something that he has done while he’s been President here — the CHIPS and Science Act, as you — you all know. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is something that he’s been — he’s done as well. And he has signed into law more than 200 pieces of legislation that were bipartisan.
So, look, he’s looking forward to having those conversations with congressional Republicans. And — and what his focus is, and he’s been very clear about this, is delivering for the American people, continuing to give them that little bit of breathing room.
And once we have that meeting set, we certainly will share that.
Q And then, when it comes to the lame-duck, you talk about the bipartisanship idea. He’s going to need at least 10 Republicans on a government spending package if an omnibus is going to move forward. Has he been given any signals by Senate Republican leadership that there will be 10 Republicans for an overarching full fiscal year deal?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, when it comes to the government funding, you know, our efforts to secure the needed government funding are in good hands with our OMB Director Shalanda Young. She is not new to this. As you know, she did — we — we — we were able to get this done in a bipartisan fashion just last year, and so she knows how to reach across the aisle. And so we are confident that we will get this done.
And, you know, we have been — our Office of Leg Affairs, the office — office at OMB, as well, has been in — has had multiple calls with congressional members and staffers and also have done briefings about how important it is in reaching an agreement — a full-year appropriations agreement and the dangers of passing the buck yet again.
And not only that — I think you all saw, just last night, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Austin, put out a letter he wrote to Congress, and he said — he said — he warned that a continuing resolution of any length would “result in significant harm” to the American people, military programs, and our national security, and our competitiveness.
We have to remember the programs that we’re talking about are not partisan programs; they are programs that’s going to help American families. We’re talking about education. We’re talking, as I just mentioned, as the Secretary said, our national security. You know, we’re talking about things that really, truly matter to the American people: education, cutting-edge technology. All of these things are not — are not partisan issues. And so we should be able to get this done in a bipartisan way just like we did last year.
Go ahead.
Q Thanks, Karine. You mentioned earlier about how passing an assault weapons ban would be an uphill battle, especially given the breakdown in Congress. I wonder if there are other things the President is considering, whether it’s executive authority or calling on state governors to take action at the state level. What are some of the other things that are — that the President is considering?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, so let me just first state — I get your question, but let me just first state a couple of things. Number one, this President has taken more executive action in his first — first year and a half on dealing with gun violence than any other President. And that shows his commitment in what he has been able to do and wanting to make sure to protect our communities. And so I just want to be very clear on that.
And let’s not forget, just a couple of months ago, there was a bipartisan legislation on protecting our communities to really deal with the effects of gun violence. And so that is something that happened. That was the first time we were able to see that type of legislation in 30 years.
So, again, I have said this: The President is an optimist, but he also understands that it is — he sees it as his responsibility to continue to make the case. I don’t have anything else to preview as to any additional executive action that will be taken from here.
But again, we have seen action on this during his presidency that we hadn’t seen in 30 years.
Q I got another question about tomorrow. The President is going to Michigan. Do you have a preview on what he plans to say and sort of what that portends for his future travel during the lame duck and into the new Congress?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, I actually do. I have something to share for you all to preview.
So, as you just mentioned, the President is going to be going to Michigan, specifically Bay City, Michigan, to discuss the American manufacturing boom.
Thanks to his economic strategy, the President will visit a ma- — a new manufacturing facility recently opened by SK siltron, which last year announced a $300 million expansion of its Michigan operations.
During his remarks, President Biden will highlight his economic plan is leading to a manufacturing boom, growing the economy, and creating good-paying jobs in Michigan and also just across the country as well.
As you all know, the economy has created more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs. And that is 10 million total jobs created under this President in his first almost two years here in — in the White House.
He will also discuss Democrats’ success in the midterm elections in Michigan, thanks to our efforts to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out to protect democracy, as you’ve heard the President speak to, and to protect women’s reproductive healthcare, which is something that the President and the Vice President is committed to doing.
I would expect more coming from us this evening. We usually do a background call or have some information out there for you all to just lay out exactly what you can expect from — from the trip.
Go ahead.
Q On the rail issue again, you know, when this was — the tentative agreement was announced a few months back, it sort of let — it was after — what? — an hours-long overnight meeting with all of the parties involved, with the Labor Secretary.
Have the talks reached that level of intensity, that level of engagement with the administration? And if not, is that a strategy we would see employed again, essentially putting all of the parties in a room overnight, however long it takes, and nobody leaves us until there’s a deal?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, totally appreciate the question. Look, the President has been very clear: A shutdown will be unacceptable.
As I mentioned, Secretary Walsh has been in direct contact with the unions — the rail unions. Secretary Buttigieg has been in touch with the rail companies. And — and Secretary Vilsack has been in touch with th

JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Bonjour.
Q Bonjour!
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, nice! Okay. Get into the spirit, folks.
Okay. So, we are pleased to welcome President and Mrs. Macron and the delegation from France to the United States. Above all, this visit is a celebration of the strong French-U.S. relationship and the personal relationship between President Biden and President Macron.
Just a few hours ago, President Macron joined Vice President Harris for a briefing at NASA headquarters. The visit underscores our deepening collaboration on space and — on space, and came on the heels of the very first U.S.-France Comprehensive Space Dialogue, which was held in Paris last month. And it delivers on a commitment made by Vice President Harris and President Macron during her visit to Paris last year.
Looking towards tomorrow, I know everyone is eager to hear more details about the state dinner itself. Today, the First Lady is — actually, happening right now — is hosting a media preview with the White House Social Secretary, Carlos Elizondo, followed by presentations from White House Executive Chef Cris Comerford and White House Executive Pastry Chef Susie Morrison. At that preview, they are sharing information about the menu and the décor for the state dinner.
I also wanted to share some good economic news. First, this morning, we learned that our economy grew at even stronger pace in the third quarter than we previously thought. American consumers continue to spend and American businesses continue to invest here at home at even higher — at even stronger pace.
Second, as of today, the average price of gas is now below $3.50 a gallon for the first time since February, before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. And the most common price for gas is $2.99. Gas prices are down about $1.52 per gallon since June, for a savings of $160 per month for American families with two cars.
Finally, American consumers should continued — showed continued strength with record holiday spending, including on Black Friday and also this week on Cyber Monday.
According to the National Retail Federation, a record number of holiday shoppers returned to stores from Thanksgiving through Monday. And Adobe Analytics reported consumers spent a record $35 billion online over just five days.
It will take time to bring inflation back down to normal, but the American people showed — showed that they still have confidence that the President’s economic plan is indeed working.
As the President said yesterday, he’ll work with anyone — Democrat, Republican, or independent — with ideas on how we can provide working families breathing room and build a stronger, more resilient economy for the long haul. That’s what the American people voted for in November.
With that, Colleen, you want to kick us off?
Q Sure. Thank you. There are reports that the Islamic State leader has been killed, and I wondered if you can confirm that and also whether the U.S. was involved at all and if it was a U.S.-led attack or — I’m sorry — operation.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, earlier today, ISIS publicly announced the death of al- — al-Qurayshi, the overall leader of ISIS.
This follows the same fate of his predecessor, Hajji Abdullah, who was killed in a U.S.-led raid in February in North- — Northwestern Syria.
We are pleased to see the removal of ISIS’s top leaders in such quick succession. The United States remains committed to countering the global threat from ISIS and stands ready to work with international partners who share that same goal.
We will — we build — we will build on these counterterrorism successes, and we will keep that pressure on for sure.
As far as any involvement with — by us, by the U.S., as it relates to the death of al-Qurayshi, there was no re- — it was not a result of any U.S. action, I can confirm.
Q Okay, thank you. And then, another question on Indiana. The Indiana Attorney General has asked the State Medical Board to sanction the doctor who spoke out about performing an abortion on a 10-year-old girl from Ohio.
I just wondered what the — you know, the White House’s thoughts were on that effort, whether it, you know, could potentially send a chilling effect or cause a chilling effect to other doctors — whether doctors should be speaking out about this. I just sort of wondered where the White House stood on this.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I can’t speak about the details of the Indiana AG’s request to the medical board. But there’s a couple of things I do want to lay out and take a step back, because it’s — it’s a truly ho- — a horrifying situation. We’re talking about a 10-year-old child here who was raped and could not receive healthcare in her home state of Ohio and was forced to travel because she was raped and had to go to another state, clearly as you have all — some of you have reported.
A doctor who provided reproductive care to a child that was raped is now being accused of violating patient privacy by an elected official. That is what we’re seeing, and that is what is currently happening.
And if that was not enough — if that weren’t enough, he is asking the state medical board to discipline the doctor for speaking out about patients in desperate need of care.
And this is not about the concerns of the victim. This is not about the victim at all. This is an elected official going after a doctor for helping a child who was raped and seeking healthcare.
And — and broadly speaking here — and you’ve heard us say this before — I know there was a lot of concern in here back in October on whether there was too much focus on women’s — women losing their constitutional right. And — and, as you can see, there should — there should be more concern.
And these types of situations are very real, and they are very much interests of the American people. We saw that in this past election. This is something that the American people care about. This is something that women care about. They want us to continue to fight for their rights, to fight for the freedom that they’ve had for almost 50 years when Roe was in place.
So, the fact is that Americans do not want politicians making their healthcare decisions for them. And we saw that, from Kentucky to Michigan, Americans rejected — they rejected backwards, dangerous proposals.
But what we continue to see from Republican officials just across — across the country is that they want to — to take away that right, to take away that freedom.
So, the President is — and the Vice President is going to do everything that they can to continue to fight for Americans’ freedom and their — and for their rights.
Q Can I have one more quick one?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sure.
Q I’m sorry. The Prince and Princess of Wales are going to be in Boston this Friday, I think. Will the President meet them or see them or hang out with them at all? (Laughter.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Hang out? Okay. So, the President intends to greet the Prince and Princess of Wales when he is in Boston. We are still finalizing and working through the details, so I don’t have any — anything more to share — any more specifics to share on that.
Go ahead, Mary.
Q The President released a statement praising the House for passing this bill to avert a shutdown of the rails. He says he wants it on his desk immediately. But he didn’t mention this separate bill guaranteeing seven days of paid sick leave for rail workers. Does the President also back and support this legislation? Does he also want that on his desk immediately?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I just want to say a couple of things — that the President believes that a bill averting a rail strike needs to reach his desk by this weekend. He is very clear about that, because we need to protect the American families from potential devastating effects of a real shutdown. And we have talked about that numerous times, and the President was really clear about that when he — when he put out his statement earlier this week.
The President, of course — of course, he supports paid sick leave for all Americans, including rail workers. But he does not support any bill or amendment that will delay getting this bill to his desk by this Saturday. And he is — he’s been very clear about that.
Again, he’s a President for all Americans, and he believes that we need to avert a potential — this potential shutdown that would have a devastating effect on our economy, a devastating effect on jobs, a devastating effect in our communities across the country, and our — and our farms, as well.
Q What is the President’s message to union workers, rail workers across the country who backed the President, who helped him get elected, believed that he was standing with them, and who feel that he has betrayed them?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, the President, as you know, has been — has been called by union — unions and labor leaders as a pro-union President. And he takes that very seriously.
He is the most pro-union President in history. And he’s worked tirelessly to secure victories for unions and for workers since he was first elected to Sen- — to the Senate.
So, this is — this is — when it comes to labor, when it comes to unions, this is something that he has worked towards, in making sure that he delivers for — for what he called yesterday, if you listened to him during his Michigan — his Michigan statement, he said they were the backbone; they built our middle class, right?; they were the best workers that we have in this country.
And so as a proud pro-union President, he’s reluctant to override the ratifications proce- — procedures of individual unions, right?
We have to remember: There were 12 unions involved in this. When the tentative agreement was done, when — when that agreement came out, it was praised. We received praise from rail unions and — and from folks and from the companies as well. And once that agreement came to fruition — because of the work that this President did on September 15th, there was a cooling period and it was ratified by 8 of those 4 — 8 — 8 unions of the 12.
And so, look, we have to remember: There are really good — good — good — you know, good pieces in this — in this deal. There’s a 24 percent pay raise and a $5,000 bonus; no changes in co-pays, deductibles, or — or coinsurance cost; some time off for routine preventive and emergency medical care; and protecting the two-man crew.
This is — you know, this is a deal that has a lot of benefits. But, again, he wants to make sure that we — you know, we avert a shutdown that would be detrimental to our economy.
Go ahead.
Q Thanks, Karine. Europe and France are concerned about Buy America provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, and President Macron is expected to raise that during his visit. What will the President — President Biden — say in response to those concerns?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I’m not going to get into hypotheticals about what may come up in that conversation.
Q I think they flagged that they’re going to bring it up.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, but, still, I’m —
Q So, it’s not hypothetical.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m — well, it’s hypothetical because it hasn’t happened yet. They may have flagged that. I’m not going to speak for France. Clearly, I’m just speaking for this President. I speak for the President of the United States. So, right now, it is a hypothetical that it will come up, right?
And — but I will say this: The Inflation Reduction Act, as we know, is historical. It will — you know, it is an investment that will — historical investment that will deal with climate change in a real way. It will lower costs for American families — if you think about healthcare, if you think about energy costs as well.
And just a couple of things: There’s a number of provisions that will contribute to the growth of clean energy sector globally. And that is important to note. It presents significant opportunities for European firms, as well as benefits to EU energy security. And this is not a zero-sum game for us.
And so, we see a constructive path of engagement with the EU on this. And we continue to discuss this issue at all levels of the U.S. government.
Again, you know, I’m not — I’m just not going to get ahead of — of what will be on the agenda in their conversation.
Q But it sounds like, from your prepared response, that you’re prepared to talk about it.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: We’re always prepared to talk about issues that may — that may come up, certainly — certainly, with — with our allies. As you know, France is our oldest ally. And — and the President looks forward to — to meeting with President Macron.
We — you know, we read the news — the news reports and your reportings as well. We — we have heard — we’ve heard President Macron’s comments.
So, you know, of course, we’re ready to have that conversation, but just don’t want to get into a potential hypothetical. Maybe it comes up and maybe it doesn’t.
But the President is very proud of this Inflation Reduction Act. It will have true benefits for American families, and it’s historical.
Q Do you have a response to Fed Chair Powell’s remarks about inflation today?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, let me — I have a little bit of what we wanted to say about that. Give me one second here.
So, when it comes to his comments, as you know, we are very clear about the Fed having their independence and respecting that independence. As we know, prior Presidents have — have not made that — made that clear. And it was — it was not something that they — they did — many of them did not do.
So, we want to give the Fed the space to do the work that they — they need. They have the best monetary tools to deal with inflation.
Our economic team continues to believe that thanks to the President’s economic team and his economic plan, we can bring inflation down without giving up the historic gains that we have made. Our economy has added 10 million jobs, and unemployment is near a 50-year low.
And so, as I just stated, we saw that economic growth last quarter — that was even stronger than previously estimated. At pre- — it was previously estimated at 2.6 percent, and now we’re seeing at 2.9 percent.
So, again, you know, as the Chair said today, bottlenecks in goods production are easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing. And so that — that is important.
But I want to be very clear: We’re going to give them their — kind of, their ability to — to work in an independent way, and not going to interfere.
Bless you, Emilie. (Laughter.)
Go ahead.
Q Thanks, Karine. Just to follow up a little bit on Mary’s question. Given the close ties the administration has to the labor movement, have there been conversations, maybe behind the scenes, kind of explaining the “why” here or kind of detailing the decision-making process with the labor movement?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I mean, look — and we’ve said this; I said this the other day — Secretary Walsh has been in touch with the rail union. Secretary Buttigieg has been in touch with the companies. The President has been, clearly, in touch with congressional leaders and his administration. And — and Secretary Vilsack has been in close touch with the agriculture sector.
But just to — just to just give a little bit of a timeline here — you know, the President and his team have been directly engaged in supporting negotiations and averting a shutdown for months now.
In July, if — as you recall, like we’ve talked about it right here in the briefing room, the unions asked him to constitute a Presidential Emergency Board, a request they made because they know he — he is indeed a pro-union President. And he did just that.
After the PEB, he brought the full weight of his administration to bear to keep the parties at the table and to get employers to make concessions, and they did. So, he made it possible for the unions to secure a tentative agree- — agreements in September that secured a higher pay — I just mentioned 24 percent, and you’ve seen that also in the President’s statement — and a $5,000 bonus for — for workers.
Those tentative agreements kept our rail system working and prevented a disruption to our economy. And just want to add: You know, there was a cooling-off period once that September 15th tentative agreement was made. In that cooling-off period, those 12 unions were given the opportunity to — for them to — to ratify or vote for that tentative agreement. Again, eight of them ratified it. That’s a majority of the 12. And — and — and so, we wanted to give the last two unions who voted in lat- — in late November their opportunity to make their voices heard.
And so, that’s kind of how you saw the process the last couple of months. We’ve been engaged. We’ve been, certainly, working with them on — on coming to this tentative agreement.
And — and now we’re at a place where the President has been very clear that we have to avert a rail shutdown. And he’s asking Congress to act. He’s very pleased by what the Speaker and the leadership was able to do today in the House to move that forward.
Q Just one more quick one. This happened just an hour or two ago, so it may be a little bit too new. But there were roughly a dozen Republican senators threatening to block the annual defense policy bill, which you guys need to finish before the end of the year, unless they get a vote on an amendment that would end the military’s COVID vaccine mandate.
One, do you have a response to that push? And two, more broadly, are there any — is there any thought to making changes on that anytime in the future?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, I — this is the first I’m hearing of this. As you said, it’s very new. And so, I will, certainly, let the Department of Defense speak to their own COVID vaccine requirement. And so, I’m just not going to get more into that. I’ll talk to the team further on — as to exactly what the specifics are of the — these members and what they’re saying.
Q Thanks, Karine.
Q I just want to go back and clarify. On the proposed seven-day paid leave amendment or stand-alone that was passed by the House, however it’s taken on in the Senate, does the President support that proposal?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So the President, again, believes that it is important to avert a rail strike, and that is what he’s focusing on. And he wants to bring — make sure that there’s an agreement that’s brought to his desk by the weekend to — again, to protect American families, to protect jobs, to protect farms, and to protect communities across the — across the country.
The President, of course, supports — he supports paid sick leave for all Americans and for — including rail workers. This is something, as you have seen him over the past almost two years, talk about that and try to move forward in making sure — in — in — in getting paid sick leave.
But he understands there are not 60 votes, right? There are not 60 votes in the Senate to make that happen. His number one priority is that — is making sure that we get this done. So, he is — does not support any bill or amendment that will delay a bill that’s getting to his desk by Saturday.
Q All right. Two other quick ones. Does he have a plan to meet with the new House Democratic leadership?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have anything to — to preview for you at this time on a meeting.
Q He hasn’t spoken with them yet today?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have any calls to preview at this time.
Q And this was brought up on a background call yesterday previewing today’s Tribal Nations Conference, and those on that call said they didn’t have anything on it. I’m just curious, maybe, if you do.
Does the President support the Cherokee Nation’s push to get a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives, which would make good on an 1835 treaty that was supposed to seat one?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m just going to repeat what you heard on the background call. We just don’t have anything to share on that at this time.
Go ahead, Peter.
Q Thank you, Karine. Kevin McCarthy says that he invited President Biden down to the border. Has the President RSVPed? (Laughter.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: To — (Laughs.)
Q Well, we know — we know the President has never been down to the border. The possible next Speaker says that he wants him to go with him. So, is he going to?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, he’s been there. He’s been to the border. And since he took office —
Q When — when did he go to the border?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Since he took office, the — President Biden has been taking action to fix our immigration system and secure our border. And that’s why, on day one, he put forward an immigration — immigration reform — a piece of legislation to deal with what is currently happening at the border.
But, you know, that — we’re not seeing that from Republicans. We’re not seeing a willingness to work with us on — on, you know, fixing a situation that’s been around for decades now.
Instead, they’re — they’re doing political stunts. That’s what they want to do. That’s how they want to take care of this situation.
But, in the meantime, you know, the President has secured record levels of funding for the Department of Homeland Security. We have over 23,000 agents working to secure the border. We’ve taken thousands of smugglers off the streets, and we’re cutting down on asylum processing times. And the number of individuals arriving unlawfully from northern Central America and Venezuela is coming down significantly because of the actions that the President has taken.
Q Okay. On another subject, when are you guys going to delete the White House Twitter account?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Why would we do that?
Q Well, you’re saying that you’re keeping an eye on Twitter because it might not be a suitable platform. So why use it?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I want to be very clear here: The President has always said and he has been very — very clear in his belief that it is important of social media platforms to continue to take steps to reduce hate speech and misinformation. And he’ll — we’ll continue to say that, but media platforms make independent choices about their information that they present.
And so, look, I don’t have anything to share on any policy or any changes that we will be making. We have multiple platforms, as you know, that we utilize to communicate with the American people.
Q When you say that you’re going to be monitoring some of the speech on there, if you see something that you don’t like, would you try to shut Twitter down?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, you know, when you — when you talk about monitoring, you know, it is — I hate to break it to you, Peter: Just like everybody else, we very much monitor the news. We pay close attention to everything that you all are reporting, and — and Twitter is in the news a lot. And so that’s what we’re paying attention to. We’re paying attention to what is in the news and what is being reported on — on the misinformation that’s out there.
Let’s not forget there’s groups like NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and the public health leaders have been very vocal about their concerns as well.
So, yes, we are reading what you all are writing and looking at what you all are reporting about the misinformation that is out there. But, you know, I would hope that all Americans, including social media companies, civil rights organizations, as I just laid out, including Fox as well, will agree that we need to — you know, we need to — to, you know, call out hate speech and misinformation.
Q Hi, Karine. Thank you. Was there any consensus among the leaders yesterday about how to deal with the debt ceiling in the meeting the President hosted?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I don’t have anything beyond what we — what we laid out for you all in the — in our readout. And as you know —
Q Was it a topic of conversation?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Again, I don’t have anything else to lay out. I’m not going to go beyond what we talked about. We talked about the — as — as you know, the President talked to them about — the four leaders — about the rail situation, the rail strike, and averting that, making sure that we don’t put the American people through an economic — potential economic downturn, and also the government funding. Those are the things that they — that I can tell you that they did definitely speak about.
Q Just ticking off a couple fast ones here. Earlier, we heard from John Kirby on this issue, but as hours matter here, I’m just going to ask for any update. Has the U.S. had any new contact with Paul Whelan in the course of today to get a better sense of his wellbeing, his whereabouts?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I don’t have anything else to share from — beyond what you heard from my colleagues. Our embassy in Moscow has been working to understand exactly Paul’s condition and why his family hasn’t heard from him. It is a concern. We’re all worried — very much worried about Paul and about Brittney Griner as well.
As we have said repeatedly, they shouldn’t be detained in the first place. They should be home with their families today. But we will keep — we’ll keep — keep working on bringing them home.
Just don’t have anything further to share.
Q Let me ask you — you said the President is going to have a chance to greet, in some form, the royals when they’re in Boston later this week. He’s supposed to be in Boston this week for a greeting with them and, it turns out, for a Democratic fundraiser that’s taking place there to help support Democratic candidates. Why is the President attending a Democratic fundraiser in Massachusetts and has no plans, as best we understand at this point, to go to Georgia where there is a Democratic candidate who’s facing a tight challenge?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, first, let me just say, the Hatch Act, I want to be really careful; this is an ongoing race that’s — that’s current — that’s current, and so want to be careful on how I —
Q But about his schedule, I guess, I can (inaudible).
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, no, I just want to state that out there, the Hatch Act. I am covered under the Hatch Act.
One of the things I would argue, Peter, that we saw over the last several months is that it didn’t matter where the President went; his message very much resonated — his message on his economic policy, how he was delivering for the American people. We talked about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Legislation. We talked about the American Rescue Plan and how that was able to bring our economy back on track. We talked about the Inflation Reduction Act. And we made that contrast very clearly with — with Congress and what Republicans in Congress were trying to do. And that — and that worked. Right? That worked. It was —
Q Let me ask you a quick one, and then maybe to follow, which is perhaps yes/no. Does the President believe it would help or hurt Raphael Warnock for him to campaign with him in Georgia?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I’m not going to get into any political strategy here. That is not my place to do that at the podium. I have said many times before at the podium the President is willing to help Senator Warn- — Warnock any way he can in however the senator wants him to get involved.
Q Thanks, Karine.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay.
Q Thanks, Karine. Is the administration getting involved in helping an American citizen who was arrested on a visit to the UAE? He’s facing possible extradition to Egypt. He’s criticized the Egyptian president in videos he made in the U.S.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I don’t know much about this particular individual that you’re asking me about.
When it comes to wrongfully detained U.S. citizens, the President has been very clear that his administration is going to do everything that they can to bring them home.
This particular individual, I don’t have any information for you at this time. We’d have to check with the team.
Q Karine, let me ask you this: The President last night had a statement praising the Senate for passage of the Respect for Marriage Act. But as you know, there are members of the LGBT community who argue that the bill is weak sauce; it doesn’t go far enough to protect the rights of same-sex married couples in the event that Obergefell does get struck down. What’s the White House’s message to those who are concerned that the bill doesn’t go far enough?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, you saw the President’s statement last night. This is a huge step forward. And it is historic that we saw this movement from Congress in a bipartisan way to protect same-sex marriage. And I think, you know, in the time that we’re in, when we’re talking about the differences between Republicans and Democrats and how we’re not able to get things done, we’re seeing that right now in an issue — a key issue that matters to this community.
Again, it’s a step forward. There’s still work to be done to get it across the finish line. But I do think and we do think it’s something to celebrate.
Is there — there’s always going to be — need to be more work to do in any legislation that is passed, right? We’re always going to want it to be perfect. But I think it is important to note that we are taking, again, a historic step forward.
The President is very proud of the work that Congress is doing — doing this in a bipartisan way — to deal with an issue that he has fought on for many years. And you’ve heard him say people should be allowed to choose who they love, and love is love.
Q Can I follow up on that, Karine?
Q Thank you. I want to follow up on the rail issue. Senator Sanders and about a dozen other Democratic senators released a statement earlier today essentially saying that President Biden did well in the initial negotiations but Congress should do better. They called out the rail industry specifically for making record profits of more than $20 billion over the past three quarters, and essentially said that they should use some of those profits to put it back towards their workers and make sure their workers have paid sick leave. I wonder what the President makes of those comments.
We’ve heard the President before call out industries. He’s called out the gas — the oil and gas industry for making record profits and not putting that back towards consumers. Does he feel the same way about the rail industry?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I want to be very clear here: The temporary agreement that the President was able to secure
in September — on September 15th — as you know, that’s when we announced it — had some real wins for workers. It really did. Again, the concessions he secured for workers included a 24 percent pay raise and a $5,000 bonus; no changes in copay, deductibles, or co-insurance costs; for the operating crafts, some time off for routine, preventative, and emergency medical care; and protecting the two-man crew.
The victories he helped secure for workers is why the deal was ratified — it was ratified by 8 of the 12 unions. And we have to remember — right? — if — if we were to be in a rail shutdown, it will hurt the very families that we’re talking about, that you’re asking me about. Right? It would hurt the union families as well, and union workers.
And so, you know, he was asked to get involved in July. He did. He put together the Presidential Emergency Board. And he put the full — you know, the full — the fullness of — the full weight of the administration to get to this temporary agreement.
And, again, I just listed out the — listed out some real concrete gains that we saw because of the President’s involvement.
Q So, this message from Democrats that there’s corporate greed involved and that’s one of the reasons why, you know, they can’t have an agreement here, the President doesn’t agree that the rail — the rail industry —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: What I’m saying is that the President was — was able to put together a ten- — a temporary agreement that prevented a downturn, a disruption in our economy that would have hurt all families. And there are some consis- — some really true wins that came out of this agreement because of the work that this President did.
But, look, I’ve said this many times and he has said this many times: He’s the President for all Americans. Right? And it is important that we avert a rail shutdown. It is unacceptable. It would hurt farms, it would hurt jobs, it would hurt communities across — across the country.
And so, that is what the President is focused on: How is he going to help all Americans here?
Go ahead.
Q Thank you, Karine. Again, on the IRA issue and Macron’s visit, it seems like both sides have been — in public, have been toying around this issue a bit because no one wants to spoil the public face of this state visit.
But during his lunch today, Macron said some pretty — some pretty harsh words about the IRA. He said, for example, it is super aggressive against French com- — competition — competitors, and it’ll “kill” — quote, “kill” jobs in the EU.
So, I know you’ve said that you’ve taken it into account and you’re considering and so on. But does the President — he’ll be meeting with Macron for hours, I guess, tomorrow. Does he — does he have some kind of sympathy for the straits that Macron seems to say that he’s in on this?
And, you know, in other words, is he really taking this on board as a — as a very acute problem, the President? Because that seems to be the way Macron is putting it out there.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I’m not going to get ahead of what’s going to be on the agenda for their visit tomorrow. I’m not going to get ahead on what they’re going to talk about — the topics that they will be discussing.
I’ve been very clear: France is the United States’ oldest ally. This visit is about reaffirming their relationship. And you’ve seen yourselves the relationship, in person, when they — when they’ve met a few times during — during this President’s almost two years’ tenure here.
They have a very warm friendship. It is an important relationship and — that the President takes very seriously and I know that President Macron does as well.
But, look, there’s a number of provisions that we think will contribute to the growth of the clean energy sector globally, as I mentioned already, in the Inflation Reduction Act. And it presents significant opportunities for European firms as well as benefits to EU energy security. This is not a zero-sum game.
But we have to remember the Inflation Reduction Act is a historic piece of legislation that’s going to lower costs for the American people. And it’s also going to invest — a historic investment into dealing with climate change in a real way.
So, not going to get into hypotheticals about what’s going to be said or how the President is going to deal with X, Y, Z.
What I can tell you is we are — we welcome the President — President of France and his wife. And the President is looking forward to having conversations with him.
Q Just — just a quickie scheduling kind of thing. The French press people have put out that he’s having dinner — the two are having dinner tonight with their spouses, I guess, at a restaurant. A “private dinner” they’re calling it. Can you confirm that? (Inaudible)?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have anything to preview at this time.
Go ahead, April.
Q Karine, I want to go back to the rail strike — or potential thereof. And I want to drill down on what you continue to say: hurt. The hurt.
You know, this White House, this administration — on the Hill, you guys are rallying the economy as some are concerned about what the first quarter — the end of the first quarter could look like in 2023.
Could you qualify and quantify what that hurt looks like? Because you keep talking about the union people and their families, but it’s broader than that.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, absolutely. Let me break it down exactly what this could look like. And it would have — a rail shutdown would have a grinding effect on our economy to halt and touch the lives of nearly every family across the country. Even in the days before a rail stoppage, serious disruptions will begin to occur.
A couple of examples here: By Friday, Class 1 railroads will likely begin to notify their customers of the wind-down process. Just the announcement would disrupt supply chains as companies begin to reschedule shipments from rail to truck.
As soon as this weekend, Class 1 railway — railroads may begin to refuse to transport hazardous materials, like chemicals necessary to treat drinking water and wastewater.
Oil and gas refineries, unable to ship out hazardous byproducts, will stop producing diesel and gasoline, creating supply constraints.
The auto sector could also be disrupted as soon as this weekend as well.
Last time around, the railroads began refusing to transport automobiles about a week ahead of the shut — shutdown deadline.
So, again, Congress must get a bill to the President’s desk this weekend to protect families and — from these potential devastating impacts. So, this is what we’re talking about. These are real-life, you know, changes and impacts that we can see here.
Q So, with that said — and thank you for all that. I didn’t expect you to have it. Thank you.
But at the end of the day, you are fighting inflation, this White House is fighting inflation, and it sounds like the numbers will go up again. What is in place, what are you guys working on in case there is a strike? Understanding those numbers and all the things that you qualify and quantify, what is in place to cushion the American taxpayer’s pocketbook or the American consumer’s pocketbook with this knowledge that you have?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, let me just — on inflation for a second — and it’s — I do want to point out that we’ve seen a recent months — in recent months, which is inflation slowing in the third quarter compared to first and second quarters. So, that’s good news.
And in the last CPI, we’ve seen prices fall for used cars, apparel, inflation moderation for housing, food, and services — all welcome news as we head into the holidays. So, we have seen that in the data points in the past several months. So, that’s important to note.
And as I’ve said many times, when it comes to the President’s economic — economic plan, inflation is lowering — lowering costs and dealing with inflation, fighting inflation is the President’s number-one priority.
At the beginning of the briefing, I laid out gas prices — how much it’s fallen. The average — the gas price that you see — that you’ll see is about $2.99. It’s gone down by more than $1.50 per gallon. And that’s because of the work that this President has done with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, making historic — taking historic action.
So, that matters as well. We are certainly working towards that.
But, look, the President is confident that Congress is going to act on this, that we are going to, you know, work to avert a rail — a railway shutdown.
That’s why you saw the House today — he complimented the House, the Speaker, and the leadership to getting the — moving the bill forward. And it included Democrats and Republicans. Right?
So, we saw a — a interest of getting this done across the — across the spectrum. So, we’re going to continue to work towards that. It’s going to go to the Senate next. And the per- — the President and his team is going to continue to encourage members to get it done.
Q Related to that, is the administration still engaged with rail companies, the unions, in the event — to sort of keep talks going in the event that the Senate is either unable to get this passed or maybe is delayed in getting this passed?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we are — again, we are confident, and — and we are going to continue to push to get this done. The President is going to conti- — and his team is going to continue to work Congress to make sure that we avert a rail — a rail shutdown. As we know, it will have catastrophic — you know, catastrophic effects and impacts to our economy. So, we’re going to — we’re going to stay on track there.
Yes — is our administration continuing to having those conversations I laid out? Walsh has talk — Walsh has — has been talking to unions for the past several months. That continues. I’ve talked about Secretary Buttigieg, Department of Transportation, talking to the companies. That will continue. And also, Secretary Vilsack is doing his part with the agriculture sectors.
So, those conversations are always going to continue, but right now our priority is working with Congress. The President talked to the four leaders, as you know, yesterday about this particular issue. He’s going to continue to talk to congressional members. Our team is going to continue to work on that to make sure that we avert this — make sure we put legislation forward that averts this — this rail shutdown.
Q But just to clarify, there are sort of ongoing negotiations between the unions and the rail companies?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, I can’t speak for the unions and the rail companies. That is — they’re going to have their conversations. I’m not speaking for them. I’m speaking for the President and what he’s trying to do for the American people, and it’s to avert a rail shutdown.
Q Thanks, Karine. Going back to tomorrow’s state dinner, can you tell me what kind of COVID precautions will be in place? And do people — are people attending this dinner required to get a COVID test?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I can say this: As always, we will follow the CDC guidelines. So, I’d point you to the CDC guidelines when it — as it relates to COVID protocols. And I’m just going to point you to their website.
Q But as far as testing, do people —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Again, I’m just going to point you to the CDC guid- — guidance on this.
Go ahead.
Q Thanks. Following up on the Powell comments, I know you can’t comment on Fed policy, but can you just tell us how confident is the White House right now that the U.S. will be able to avoid a recession?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, I just laid out the data points in the beginning of this — beginning — beginning of — of my — of my briefing when I talked about how the third quarter — there was a revision in the third quarter and how much it’s growing. Right? It was we — it was first said it was going to be estimated at 2.6 percent. And we’re seeing it at 2.9 percent.
Look, we believe that this is an economy that’s resilient. We believe that — and it’s resilient because of the President’s work and because of the President’s economic plan, because of what he did walking into this administration and putting forth the American Rescue Plan. That got schools open. That got arm — shots in arms, as it relates to the vaccine. Put forward a real comprehensive plan so those schools could be open, so that small businesses could open up again.
And — and it’s continued through the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, creating jobs with the inflat- — Inflation Reduction Act. This has been all part of the President’s plan to make sure that we build from the bottom up and the middle out.
And that work has created — has been able to create 10 million jobs in this administration. And we just saw the President in Bay City, Michigan, where he talked about the manufacturing jobs, bringing — bringing jobs back to the count- — to the country because of the CHIPS and Science Act, right? Seven hundred — more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs that have been created in this President’s administration because of the work that he’s done.
And so now what we’re seeing — and you’ve heard us talk about this — is we’re seeing an economy that’s going into a transition to more stable and steady growth.
So, we do not foresee a recession. The data that I just laid out — that we’ve seen the last couple months — does not show a recession.
Q Separately, House Democrats made history today when they elected Hakeem Jeffries as the first Black Leader. You know, what’s the President’s reaction to the new leadership party in the House?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, as you know, the President’s — well, the President, I should say, sends his heartfelt congratulations to his friend, Congressman Jeffries, as he marks profoundly important history becoming the first Black leader of either party in either chamber of Congress. This is wonderful news for our country and highlights the promise of the American Dream for all our people.
He has worked with Congressman Jeffries for many years delivering for the American middle class, as I just laid out, when we talk about the President’s Amer- — economic policy; standing up for fundamental constitutional rights, like the right to choose; and standing up with law enforcement to keep our communities safe in the fight against gun crime.
So he also congratulates Katherine Clark and Peter Aguilar on their elections as well. He looks forward to working with all of them in building on the progress that we — that we have made in the last almost — in the last almost two years.
Go ahead.
Q Hey, Karine, back on the border for a second. Congressman McCarthy also said that it was the President who brought up the border in the meeting. Is that accurate? And —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m not going to go beyond the readout.
Q And did you take it as a good-faith invitation to go to the border or something —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I’m just — I’m telling you right now, I’m not going to go beyond the readout that we gave — that we provided yesterday.
Q Okay. And not related, you might have seen the foreign minister of Belarus died suddenly this week at 64. He’s somebody who could maybe be a conduit to the West. But it’s also — as you know, that regime is kind of tight with Putin. What does the White House make of this?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have any comment at this time on that.
Go ahead.
Q Thank you. India tomorrow formally takes over the presidency of G20. It has announced its theme of “One Family, One Earth, and One Future” and also its agenda. But from the U.S. perspective, what should be the G20’s top priority for next year?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the President — we — we, you know, look forward to supporting India’s G20 presidency next year and on a — on a range of issues, including addressing current food and energy security challenges, while continuing our efforts to build a resilient global economy.
I know that Jake was — Jake Sullivan was asked this question when he was here, probably most recently, about if the President is going to be attending. As you’ve seen, the President has — has attended — has been participating in the G20 in his tenure here. Don’t have anything specific to announce or any — any specifics or announce on travel.
Q (Inaudible.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I just said I don’t have anything specific to announce on his travel. But as you have seen the past almost two years, he has been, certainly, participating in the G20.
Q And in neighboring Pakistan, there is a change. A new army chief has taken over: General Munir. Do you have anything on that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the United States values our longstanding cooperation with Pakistan and has always viewed a prosperous and democratic Pakistan as critical to U.S. interests.
We look forward to continue to work with Pakistan to promote stability, prosperity for the people of Pakistan and the region.
I will take one last question from the back. Someone —
Q In the back. Follow-up to —
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
Yeah, I just —
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
Go ahead.
Q I’m interested — why hasn’t the President been more involved in helping the DNC decide its early presidential primary states? Obviously, there’s four or five potential states. And there’s been a sense that the White House hasn’t, you know, been public about what states it wants to go first.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I was asked this question recently. It is a political question. It is about the 2024 elections. I cannot speak to this, so I would refer you to the — to — to the DNC. It’s not something that I can speak to from here.
One last question. Go ahead. Go ahead. The young lady in the back, go ahead.
Q Thank you. On the potential rail strikes, some representatives today putting blame on the Biden administration, saying that it should have never come to this. What went wrong, from the administration’s point of view, in September?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: We don’t think anything went wrong. We believe that — that if you think about the timeline that I laid out, that — what the President and his team has been doing — for the past several months, we’ve been directly involved, engaged in supporting negotiations and averting a shutdown. And we’ve been doing this for months.
And it was because of the President’s action back in July — the unions asked him to constitute a presidential emergency board — a request they made because they knew, as a pro-union President, he would be able to get to a — an agreement, and he did.
On September 15th, he came — came through with a temporary agreement that had — that had, you know, an increase in pay by 24 percent. It had a $5,000 bonus — it has a $5,000 bonus for workers.
And if — let’s not forget: When that agreement came out on September 15th, it was lauded and praised by the unions and union leadership.
So, again, this is a President that has delivered for — for the union, and he sees himself as a pro-union President. He’s — that — that term has been given to him by labor.
And again, what is so important right now is that we need to make sure that we avert a rail shutdown, and that’s what the President is calling on Congress to do.
You know, this is something that would have a direct effect on those union families. It would have direct effect on communities across the — across the country. It would have an impact on — you know, on farms, on jobs, on agriculture, as I just mentioned.
So, this is incredibly important that we avert this, and that’s why the President is calling on Congress to act.
Thanks, everybody.
Q Thank you. Au revoir.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Au revoir. Bonne nuit.

""The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create deposits, and with the flick of a pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again.

I know many people have a great deal of difficulty comprehending just how many wars are started for no other purpose than to force private central banks onto nations, so let me share a few examples, so that you understand why the US Government is mired in so many wars against so many foreign nations. There is ample precedent for this.
The United States fought the American Revolution primarily over King George III's Currency act, which forced the colonists to conduct their business only using printed bank notes borrowed from the Bank of England at interest.
Benjamin Franklin, acting as the colonies' representative to Britain, argued against this move in 1763.
""You see, a legitimate government can both spend and lend money into circulation, while banks can only lend significant amounts of their promissory bank notes, for they can neither give away nor spend but a tiny fraction of the money the people need. Thus, when your bankers here in England place money in circulation, there is always a debt principal to be returned and usury to be paid. The result is that you have always too little credit in circulation to give the workers full employment. You do not have too many workers, you have too little money in circulation, and that [money] which circulates all bears the endless burden of unpayable debt and usury.....In the Colonies, we issue our own money. It is called Colonial Scrip [interest-free, wealth-based money issued by The Colonies 1750-1764 before Bank of England crooks made it illegal]. We issue it in proper proportion to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power, and we have no interest to pay to no one.""
The following year, King George III passed the Currency act which outlawed all forms of money in the colonies, forcing them to conduct all commerce using bank notes borrowed at interest from the Bank of England!
The Currency Act
""The bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing."" -- William Paterson, founder of the Bank of England in 1694
After the revolution, the new United States adopted a radically different economic system in which the government issued its own value-based money, so that private banks like the Bank of England were not siphoning off the wealth of the people through interest-bearing bank notes.
""The refusal of King George 3rd to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of the money manipulators, was probably the prime cause of the revolution."" -- Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father
Following the revolution, the US Government actually took steps to keep the bankers out of the new government!
""Any person holding any office or any stock in any institution in the nature of a bank for issuing or discounting bills or notes payable to bearer or order, cannot be a member of the House whilst he holds such office or stock."" -- Third Congress of the United States Senate, 23rd of December, 1793, signed by the President, George Washington
""If ever again our nation stumbles upon unfunded paper, it shall surely be like death to our body politic. This country will crash."" -- George Washington
""All the perplexities, confusion and distresses in America arise not from defects in the constitution or confederation, nor from want of honor or virtue, as much from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation."" -- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson.
""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks... will deprive the people of all property, until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."" -- Thomas Jefferson
""Paper is poverty. It is the ghost of money and not money itself."" -- Thomas Jefferson
""History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance."" -- James Madison

When, through process of law, the common people lose their homes, they will become more docile and more easily governed through the strong arm of the government applied by a central power of wealth under leading financiers. These truths are well known among our principal men, who are now engaged in forming an imperialism to govern the world. By dividing the voter through the political party system, we can get them to expend their energies in fighting for questions of no importance. It is thus, by discrete action, we can secure for ourselves that which has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished."" -- Montagu Norman, Governor of The Bank Of England, addressing the United States Bankers Association, NYC 1924
The First Bank of the United States
But bankers are nothing if not dedicated to their schemes to acquire your wealth, and know full well how easy it is to corrupt a nation's leaders.
Mayer Amschel Rothschild""When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes... Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain."" -- Napoleon Bonaparte
Just one year after Mayer Amschel Rothschild had uttered his infamous ""Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws"", the bankers succeeded in setting up a new Private Central Bank called the First Bank of the United States, largely through the efforts of the Rothschild's chief US supporter, Alexander Hamilton.
Founded in 1791, by the end of its twenty year charter the First Bank of the United States had almost ruined the nation's economy, while enriching the bankers. Congress refused to renew the charter and signaled their intention to go back to a state issued value based currency on which the people paid no interest at all to any banker. This resulted in a threat from Nathan Mayer Rothschild against the US Government: ""Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war."" Congress still refused to renew the charter for the First Bank of the United States, whereupon Nathan Mayer Rothschild railed, ""Teach those impudent Americans a lesson! Bring them back to colonial status!"" The British Prime Minister at the time, Spencer Perceval was adamantly opposed to war with the United States, primarily because the majority of England's military might was occupied with the ongoing Napoleonic wars. Spencer Perceval was concerned that Britain might not prevail in a new American war, a concern shared by many in the British government. Then, Spencer Perceval was assassinated (the only British Prime Minister to be assassinated in office) and replaced by Robert Banks Jenkinson, the 2nd Earl of Liverpool, who was fully supportive of a war to recapture the colonies.
""If my sons did not want wars, there would be none."" -- Gutle Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild and mother of his five sons
Financed at virtually no interest by the Rothschild controlled Bank of England, Britain then provoked the war of 1812 to recolonize the United States and force them back into the slavery of the Bank of England, or to plunge the United States into so much debt they would be forced to accept a new private central bank. And the plan worked. Even though the War of 1812 was won by the United States, Congress was forced to grant a new charter for yet another private bank issuing the public currency as loans at interest, the Second Bank of the United States. Once again, private bankers were in control of the nation's money supply and cared not who made the laws or how many British and American soldiers had to die for it.
Andrew Jackson and the Second Bank of the United StatesOnce again the nation was plunged into debt, unemployment, and poverty by the predations of the private central bank, and in 1832 Andrew Jackson successfully campaigned for his second term as President under the slogan, ""Jackson And No Bank!"" True to his word, Jackson succeeded in blocking the renewal of the charter for the Second Bank of the United States.
""Gentlemen! I too have been a close observer of the doings of the Bank of the United States. I have had men watching you for a long time, and am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, (bringing his fist down on the table) I will rout you out!"" -- Andrew Jackson, shortly before ending the charter of the Second Bank of the United States. From the original minutes of the Philadelphia committee of citizens sent to meet with President Jackson (February 1834), according to Andrew Jackson and the Bank of the United States (1928) by Stan V. Henkels
Shortly after President Jackson (the only American President to actually pay off the National Debt) ended the Second Bank of the United States, there was an attempted assassination which failed when both pistols used by the assassin, Richard Lawrence, failed to fire. Lawrence later said that with Jackson dead, ""Money would be more plenty.""
Following the loss of its charter, the Second Bank of the United States tried to operate as a normal bank, but failed after just 5 years.
President Zachary TaylorPresident Zachary Taylor opposed the creation of a new Private Central Bank, owing to the historical abuses of the First and Second Banks of the United States.
""The idea of a national bank is dead, and will not be revived in my time."" -- Zachary TaylorTaylor died on July 9, 1850 after eating a bowl of cherries and milk rumored to have been poisoned. The symptoms he displayed are consistent with acute arsenic poisoning.
President James BuchananPresident James Buchanan also opposed a private central bank. During the panic of 1857 he attempted to set limits on banks issuing more loans than they had actual funds, and to require all issued bank notes to be backed by Federal Government assets. He was poisoned with arsenic and survived, although 38 other people at the dinner died.
President James BuchanonThe public school system is as subservient to the bankers' wishes to keep certain history from you, just as the corporate media is subservient to Monsanto's wishes to keep the dangers of GMOs from you, and the global warming cult's wishes to conceal from you that the Earth has actually been cooling for the last 16 years. Thus it should come as little surprise that much of the real reasons for the events of the Civil War are not well known to the average American.
""The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or be so dependent upon its favors that there will be no opposition from that class, while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantage that capital derives from the system, will bear its burdens without complaint, and perhaps without even suspecting that the system is inimical to their interests."" -- The Rothschild brothers of London writing to associates in New York, 1863President Abraham Lincoln
President Abraham LincolnWhen the Confederacy seceded from the United States, the bankers once again saw the opportunity for a rich harvest of debt, and offered to fund Lincoln's efforts to bring the south back into the union, but at 30% interest. Lincoln remarked that he would not free the black man by enslaving the white man to the bankers and using his authority as President, issued a new government currency, the greenback. This was a direct threat to the wealth and power of the central bankers, who quickly responded.
Lincoln's Greenback""If this mischievous financial policy, which has its origin in North America, shall become indurated down to a fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous without precedent in the history of the world. The brains, and wealth of all countries will go to North America. That country must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe."" -- The London Times responding to Lincoln's decision to issue government Greenbacks to finance the Civil War, rather than agree to private banker's loans at 30% interest.
In 1872 New York bankers sent a letter to every bank in the United States, urging them to fund newspapers that opposed government-issued money (Lincoln's greenbacks).
""Dear Sir: It is advisable to do all in your power to sustain such prominent daily and weekly newspapers... as will oppose the issuing of greenback paper money, and that you also withhold patronage or favors from all applicants who are not willing to oppose the Government issue of money. Let the Government issue the coin and the banks issue the paper money of the country... [T]o restore to circulation the Government issue of money, will be to provide the people with money, and will therefore seriously affect your individual profit as bankers and lenders."" -- Triumphant plutocracy; the story of American public life from 1870 to 1920, by Lynn Wheeler""It will not do to allow the greenback, as it is called, to circulate as money any length of time, as we cannot control that."" -- Triumphant plutocracy; the story of American public life from 1870 to 1920, by Lynn Wheeler""Slavery is likely to be abolished by the war power, and chattel slavery destroyed. This, I and my European friends are in favor of, for slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care for the laborer, while the European plan, led on by England, is for capital to control labor by controlling the wages. THIS CAN BE DONE BY CONTROLLING THE MONEY."" -- Triumphant plutocracy; the story of American public life from 1870 to 1920, by Lynn WheelerGoaded by the private bankers, much of Europe supported the Confederacy against the Union, with the expectation that victory over Lincoln would mean the end of the Greenback. France and Britain considered an outright attack on the United States to aid the confederacy, but were held at bay by Russia, which had just ended the serfdom system and had a state central bank similar to the system the United States had been founded on.
Tsar Alexander II of Russia, who prevented France and Britain from invading the US during the civil war. Alexander II immediately sent his fleet, headed by the frigate Oslabiya, to the New York bay. And he sent his Pacific flotilla to San Francisco with a special imperial order that it be placed under the direct command of Lincoln.Left free of European intervention, the Union won the war, and Lincoln announced his intention to go on issuing greenbacks. Following Lincoln's assassination, the Greenbacks were pulled from circulation and the American people forced to go back to an economy based on bank notes borrowed at interest from the private bankers. Tsar Alexander II, who authorized Russian military assistance to Lincoln, was subsequently the victim of multiple attempts on his life in 1866, 1879, and 1880, until his assassination in 1881.
""I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. Of the two, the one at my rear is my greatest foe."" -- Abraham Lincoln""The money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than bureaucracy."" -- Abraham Lincoln
""The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity. "" -- Abraham LincolnPresident Andrew Johnson
In Andrew Johnson's 1886 Fourth Annual Message (forerunner of the State of the Union), he dared question the validity and legitimacy of the accumulated debt. In particular the practice of allowing the banks to make loans using ink and paper but demanding repayment in silver and gold.
""The anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with that which was originally designed. Our circulation now embraces, first, notes of the national banks, which are made receivable for all dues to the Government, excluding imposts, and by all its creditors, excepting in payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves; second, legal tender, issued by the United States, and which the law requires shall be received as well in payment of all debts between citizens as of all Government dues, excepting imposts; and, third, gold and silver coin. By the operation of our present system of finance however, the metallic currency, when collected, is reserved only for one class of Government creditors, who, holding its bonds, semiannually receive their interest in coin from the National Treasury. There is no reason which will be accepted as satisfactory by the people why those who defend us on the land and protect us on the sea; the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation, bearing the scars and wounds received while in its service; the public servants in the various departments of the Government; the farmer who supplies the soldiers of the Army and the sailors of the Navy; the artisan who toils in the nation's workshops, or the mechanics and laborers who build its edifices and construct its forts and vessels of war, should, in payment of their just and hard-earned dues, receive depreciated paper, while another class of their countrymen, no more deserving are paid in coin of gold and silver. ""With the end of Lincoln's Greenbacks, the US could no longer create its own interest free money and was manipulated during the term of President Ruthford B. Hayes into borrowing from the Rothschilds banking system in 1878, restoring to the Rothschilds control of the US economy they had lost under Andrew Jackson.
Messrs. Rothschild & Sons to Mr. Sherman.[Cable message.]April 12,1878.Hon. John Sherman,Secretary of the Treasury, Washington D. C.:
Very pleased we have entered into relations again with American Government. Shall do our best to make the business successful.
ROTHSCHILDS.
President James Garfield
James A. Garfield was elected President in 1880 on a platform of government control of the money supply.
""The chief duty of the National Government in connection with the currency of the country is to coin money and declare its value. Grave doubts have been entertained whether Congress is authorized by the Constitution to make any form of paper money legal tender. The present issue of United States notes has been sustained by the necessities of war; but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its convenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the holder, and not upon its compulsory circulation. These notes are not money, but promises to pay money. If the holders demand it, the promise should be kept. -- James Garfield""By the experience of commercial nations in all ages it has been found that gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary system. Confusion has recently been created by variations in the relative value of the two metals, but I confidently believe that arrangements can be made between the leading commercial nations which will secure the general use of both metals. Congress should provide that the compulsory coinage of silver now required by law may not disturb our monetary system by driving either metal out of circulation. If possible, such an adjustment should be made that the purchasing power of every coined dollar will be exactly equal to its debt-paying power in all the markets of the world. --James Garfield""Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce, and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate."" -- President James A. Garfield, two weeks before he was assassinated
President James GarfieldGarfield was shot on July 2, 1881 and died of his wounds several weeks later. Chester A. Arthur succeeded Garfield as President.
""There is too much loose talk nowadays about the danger of so much capital in the hands of a few men."" -- Baron Alphonso Rothschild, 1892President William McKinley
In 1896, William McKinley was elected President in the middle of a depression-driven debate over gold-backed government currency versus bank notes borrowed at interest from private banks. McKinley favored gold-backed currencies and a balanced government budget which would free the public from accumulating debt.
""Our financial system needs some revision; our money is all good now, but its value must not further be threatened. It should all be put upon an enduring basis, not subject to easy attack, nor its stability to doubt or dispute. Our currency should continue under the supervision of the Government. The several forms of our paper money offer, in my judgment, a constant embarrassment to the Government and a safe balance in the Treasury."" -- William McKinley
President William McKinleyMcKinley was shot by an out-of-work anarchist on September 14, 1901, in Buffalo, NY, succumbing to his wounds a few days later. He was suceeded in office by Theodore Roosevelt.
The Aldrich Plan
In 1910, Senator Nelson Aldrich, Frank Vanderlip of National City (Citibank), Henry Davison of Morgan Bank, and Paul Warburg of the Kuhn, Loeb Investment House met secretly on Jekyll Island, Georgia, to formulate a plan for a US central bank, and created the Aldrich Plan, which called for a system of fifteen regional central banks, openly and directly controlled by Wall Street commercial banks. These banks would have the legal ability to create mnoney out of thin air and represented an attempt to create a new Bank of the United States. Public reaction was swift.
Do to the intense public opposition to the Aldrich Plan, the measure was defeated in the House of Representaives in 1912. One year later the bankers would be back!
The Third Bank of the United States, aka The Federal ReserveFollowing the defeat of the Aldrich Plan, in 1913, the Private Central Bankers of Europe, in particular the Rothschilds of Great Britain and the Warburgs of Germany, met with their American financial collaborators once again on Jekyll Island, Georgia to form a new banking cartel with the express purpose of forcing the United States to accept a private central bank, with the aim of placing complete control of the United States money supply once again under the control of private bankers. Owing to hostility over the previous banks, the name was changed from the Third Bank of the United States to ""The Federal Reserve"" system in order to grant the new bank a quasi-governmental image, but in fact it is a privately owned bank, no more ""Federal"" than Federal Express.
Former Chairman of the FED Allan Greenspan admits the Federal Reserve is a private bank and answers to no government authority.
The Federal Reserve is also exempt from all taxation, except property tax.
The Federal Reserve; it is neither ""Federal"" nor does it have any actual ""Reserves"", creating as it does money out of thin air. - Click for larger imageIn 2012, the Federal Reserve attempted to rebuff a Freedom of Information Lawsuit by Bloomberg News on the grounds that as a private banking corporation and not actually a part of the government, the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to the ""trade secret"" operations of the Federal Reserve.
""When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our account to cover the check; but when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money."" -- From the Boston Federal Reserve Bank pamphlet, ""Putting it Simply.""""Neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities. Intrinsically, a 'dollar' bill is just a piece of paper. Deposits are merely book entries."" -- ""Modern Money Mechanics Workbook"" - Federal Reserve of Chicago, 1975""I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can and do create money. And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hand the destiny of the people."" -- Reginald McKenna, as Chairman of the Midland Bank, addressing stockholders in 1924""States, most especially the large hegemonic ones, such as the United States and Great Britain, are controlled by the international central banking system, working through secret agreements at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and operating through national central banks (such as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve)... The same international banking cartel that controls the United States today previously controlled Great Britain and held it up as the international hegemon. When the British order faded, and was replaced by the United States, the US ran the global economy. However, the same interests are served. States will be used and discarded at will by the international banking cartel; they are simply tools."" -- Andrew Gavin MarshallThe 16th Amendment and the Income Tax
1913 proved to be a transformative year for the nation's economy, first with the passage of the 16th ""income tax"" Amendment and the false claim that it had been ratified.
""I think if you were to go back and and try to find and review the ratification of the 16th amendment, which was the internal revenue, the income tax, I think if you went back and examined that carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment."" - U.S. District Court Judge James C. Fox, Sullivan Vs. United States, 2003.Later that same year, and apparently unwilling to risk another questionable amendment, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act over Christmas holiday 1913, while members of Congress opposed to the measure were at home. This was a very underhanded deal, as the Constitution explicitly vests Congress with the authority to issue the public currency, does not authorize its delegation, and thus should have required a new Amendment to transfer that authority to a private bank. But pass it Congress did, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it as he promised the bankers he would in exchange for generous campaign contributions.
News report of Wilson's signing the Federal Reserve Act. Under the Constitution, only a new Amendment could transfer the government's authority to create the currency to a private party.
Woodrow Wilson later regretted that decision.
""I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit. We are no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."" -- Woodrow Wilson 1919Thomas Edison
Thomas Edison, arguably the most brilliant man of the age, was also well aware of the fraud of private central banks.
Thomas Edison""People who will not turn a shovel full of dirt on the project nor contribute a pound of material, will collect more money from the United States than will the People who supply all the material and do all the work. This is the terrible thing about interest ...But here is the point: If the Nation can issue a dollar bond it can issue a dollar bill. The element that makes the bond good makes the bill good also. The difference between the bond and the bill is that the bond lets the money broker collect twice the amount of the bond and an additional 20%. Whereas the currency, the honest sort provided by the Constitution pays nobody but those who contribute in some useful way. It is absurd to say our Country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency. Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the People. If the currency issued by the People were no good, then the bonds would be no good, either. It is a terrible situation when the Government, to insure the National Wealth, must go in debt and submit to ruinous interest charges at the hands of men who control the fictitious value of gold.""Look at it another way. If the Government issues bonds, the brokers will sell them. The bonds will be negotiable; they will be considered as gilt edged paper. Why? Because the government is behind them, but who is behind the Government? The people. Therefore it is the people who constitute the basis of Government credit. Why then cannot the people have the benefit of their own gilt-edged credit by receiving non-interest bearing currency on Muscle Shoals, instead of the bankers receiving the benefit of the people's credit in interest-bearing bonds?"" -- Thomas A. Edison, New York Times, December 4, 1921
The War to End All Wars - WW1
The next year, World War One started, and it is important to remember that prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve, there was no such thing as a world war.
World War One started between Austria-Hungary and Serbia with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.
Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination triggered World War OneAlthough the war started between Austria-Hungary and Serbia , it quickly shifted to focus on Germany, whose industrial capacity was seen as an economic threat to Great Britain, who saw the decline of the British Pound as a result of too much emphasis on financial activity to the neglect of agriculture, industrial development, and infrastructure (not unlike the present day United States). Although pre-war Germany had a private central bank, it was heavily restricted and inflation kept to reasonable levels. Under government control, investment was guaranteed to internal economic development, and Germany was seen as a major power. So, in the media of the day, Germany was portrayed as the prime opponent of World War One, and not just defeated, but its industrial base flattened. Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was ordered to pay the war costs of all the participating nations, even though Germany had not actually started the war. This amounted to three times the value of all of Germany itself. Germany's private central bank, to whom Germany had gone deeply into debt to pay the costs of the war, broke free of government control, and massive inflation followed (mostly triggered by currency speculators) , permanently trapping the German people in endless debt.
WW2When the Weimar Republic collapsed economically, it opened the door for the National Socialists to take power. Their first financial move was to issue their own state currency which was not borrowed from private central bankers. Freed from having to pay interest on the money in circulation, Germany blossomed and quickly began to rebuild its industry. The media called it ""The German Miracle"". TIME magazine lionized Hitler for the amazing improvement in life for the German people and the explosion of German industry, and even named him TIME Magazine's Man Of The Year in 1938.
Hitler as TIME's Man Of The YearOnce again, Germany's industrial output became a threat to Great Britain.
""Should Germany merchandise (do business) again in the next 50 years we have led this war (WW1) in vain."" - Winston Churchill in The Times (1919)
""We will force this war upon Hitler, if he wants it or not."" - Winston Churchill (1936 broadcast)
""Germany becomes too powerful. We have to crush it."" - Winston Churchill (November 1936 speaking to US - General Robert E. Wood)
""This war is an English war and its goal is the destruction of Germany."" - Winston Churchill (- Autumn 1939 broadcast)
""Not the political doctrine of Hitler has hurled us into this war. The reason was the success of his increase in building a new economy. The roots of war were envy, greed and fear."" -- Major General J.F.C. Fuller, historian, England
Germany's state-issued value based currency was also a direct threat to the wealth and power of the private central banks, and as early as 1933 they started to organize a global boycott against Germany to strangle this upstart ruler who thought he could break free of private central bankers!
As had been the case in World War One, Great Britain and other nations threatened by Germany's economic power looked for an excuse to go to war, and as public anger in Germany grew over the boycott, Hitler foolishly gave them that excuse. Years later, in a spirit of candor, the real reasons for that war were made clear.
""The war wasn't only about abolishing fascism, but to conquer sales markets. We could have, if we had intended so, prevented this war from breaking out without doing one shot, but we didn't want to.""- Winston Churchill to Truman (Fultun, USA March 1946)
""Germany's unforgivable crime before WW2 was its attempt to loosen its economy out of the world trade system and to build up an independent exchange system from which the world-finance couldn't profit anymore. ...We butchered the wrong pig."" -Winston Churchill (The Second World War - Bern, 1960)
Smedley ButlerMarine Corps Major General Smedley Butler.As a side note, we need to step back before WW2 and recall Marine Major General Smedley Butler. In 1933, Wall Street bankers and financiers had bankrolled the successful coups by both Hitler and Mussolini. Brown Brothers Harriman in New York was financing Hitler right up to the day war was declared with Germany.
Albeft Einstein was of the opinion that the late entry of the US into the war against Germany was because the US was controlled by bankers who were making money off of Hitler.
The Wall Street bankers decided that a fascist dictatorship in the United States based on the one on Italy would be far better for their business interests than Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" which threatened massive wealth re-distribution to recapitalize the working and middle class of America. So the Wall Street tycoons recruited General Butler to lead the overthrow of the US Government and install a ""Secretary of General Affairs"" who would be answerable to Wall Street and not the people, would crush social unrest and shut down all labor unions. General Butler pretended to go along with the scheme but then exposed the plot to Congress. Congress, then as now in the pocket of the Wall Street bankers, refused to act. When Roosevelt learned of the planned coup he demanded the arrest of the plotters, but the plotters simply reminded Roosevelt that if any one of them were sent to prison, their friends on Wall Street would deliberatly collapse the still-fragile economy and blame Roosevelt for it. Roosevelt was thus unable to act until the start of WW2, at which time he prosecuted many of the plotters under the Trading With The Enemy act. The Congressional minutes into the coup were finally declassified in 1967, but rumors of the attempted coup became the inspiration for the movie, ""Seven Days in May"" but with the true financial villains erased from the script.
""I spent 33 years and four months in active military service as a member of our country's most agile military force -- the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from second lieutenant to Major General. And during that period I spent more of my time being a high--class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. ""I suspected I was just a part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all members of the military profession I never had an original thought until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of the higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service. Thus I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-12. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that the Standard Oil went its way unmolested. During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. I was rewarded with honors, medals and promotion. Looking back on it, I feel I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three city districts. I operated on three continents."" -- General Smedley Butler, former US Marine Corps Commandant,1935
Louis T. McFaddenLouis T. McFadden was a member of the House of Representatives in the twenties and thirties. He was the chair of the House Banking and Currency Committee during the twenties. He used his position in Congress occasionally to crusade against the Federal Reserve.
""Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal reserve banks. The Federal Reserve Board, a Government board, has cheated the Government of the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt. The depredations and the iniquities of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over. This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States; has bankrupted itself, and has practically bankrupted our Government. It has done this through defects of the law under which it operates, through the maladministration of that law by the Federal Reserve Board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it."" -- Louis T. McFadden, June 10, 1932At one point McFadden started impeachment proceedings against the entire board of the federal reserve. Not too surprisingly, there were three attempts on McFadden's life, one shooting and two poisonings, the second of which was cuccessful. Although still officially declared as heart failure, newspapers of the time reported ...
""Now that this sterling American patriot has made the Passing, it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of Judah, it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attacks against his life. The first attack came in the form of two revolver shots fired at him from ambush as he was alighting from a cab in front of one of the Capital hotels. Fortunately both shots missed him, the bullets burying themselves in the structure of the cab.""He became violently ill after partaking of food at a political banquet at Washington. His life was only saved from what was subsequently announced as a poisoning by the presence of a physician friend at the banquet, who at once procured a stomach pump and subjected the Congressman to emergency treatment.""
President John F. KennedyAs President, John F. Kennedy understood the predatory nature of private central banking. He understood why Andrew Jackson fought so hard to end the Second Bank of the United States. So Kennedy wrote and signed Executive Order 11110 which ordered the US Treasury to issue a new public currency, the United States Note.
Kennedy's United States NoteKennedy's United States Notes were not borrowed from the Federal Reserve but created by the US Government and backed by the silver stockpiles held by the US Government. It represented a return to the system of economics the United States had been founded on, and was perfectly legal for Kennedy to do. All told, some four and one half billion dollars went into public circulation, eroding interest payments to the Federal Reserve and loosening their control over the nation. Five months later John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas Texas, and the United States Notes pulled from circulation and destroyed (except for samples held by collectors).
John J. McCloyJohn J. McCloy, President of the Chase Manhattan Bank, and President of the World Bank, was named to the Warren Commission, presumably to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were concealed from the public. Kennedy's E.O. 11110 has never been repealed and is still in effect, although no modern President dares to use it. Almost all of the current national debt has been created since 1963.
As we enter the eleventh year of what future history will most certainly describe as World War Three, we need to examine the financial dimensions behind the wars.
Towards the end of World War Two, when it became obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war environment, the major world economic powers met at Bretton Woods, a luxury resort in New Hampshire in July of 1944, and hammered out the Bretton Woods agreement for international finance. The British Pound lost its position as the global trade and reserve currency to the US dollar (part of the price demanded by Roosevelt in exchange for the US entry into the war). Absent the economic advantages of being the world's ""go-to"" currency, Britain was forced to nationalize the Bank of England in 1946. The Bretton Woods agreement, ratified in 1945, in addition to making the dollar the global reserve and trade currency, obligated the signatory nations to tie their currencies to the dollar. The nations that ratified Bretton Woods did so on two conditions. The first was that the Federal Reserve would refrain from over-printing the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from other nations in exchange for ink and paper; basically an imperial tax. That assurance was backed up by the second requirement, which was that the US dollar would always be convertible to gold at $35 per ounce.
The Bretton Woods resort, New HampshireThe Federal Reserve, being a private bank and not answerable to the US Government, did start overprinting paper dollars, and much of the perceived prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s was the result of foreign nations' obligations to accept the paper notes as being worth gold at the rate of $35 an ounce. Then in 1970, France looked at the huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults, for which real French products like wine and cheese had been traded, and notified the United States government that they would exercise their option under Bretton Woods to return the paper notes for gold at the $35 per ounce exchange rate. The United States had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper notes. By 1966, the IMF estimated foreign central banks held $14 billion U.S. dollars, however the United States had only $3.2 billion in gold to redeem those paper notes! So on August 15th, 1971, Richard Nixon ""temporarily"" suspended the gold convertibility of the US Federal Reserve Notes.
Nixon announces the end of gold convertabilityLater termed the ""Nixon shock"", this move effectively ended Bretton Woods and many global currencies started to delink from the US dollar.
The ""Nixon Shock""Worse, since the United States had collateralized their loans with the nation's gold reserves, it quickly became apparent that the US Government did not in fact have enough gold to cover the outstanding debts. Foreign nations began to get very nervous about their loans to the US and understandably were reluctant to loan any additional money to the United States without some form of collateral. So Richard Nixon started the environmental movement, with the EPA and its various programs such as ""wilderness zones"", Roadless areas"", Heritage rivers"", ""Wetlands"", all of which took vast areas of public lands and made them off limits to the American people who were technically the owners of those lands. But Nixon had little concern for the environment and the real purpose of this land grab under the guise of the environment was to pledge those pristine lands and their vast mineral resources as collateral on the national debt. The plethora of different programs was simply to conceal the true scale of how much American land was being pledged to foreign lenders as collateral on the government's debts; eventually almost 25% of the nation itself. All of this is illegal as the Enclave Clause of the Constitution limits the Federal Government to owning the land under Federal Government buildings and military bases, and that Enclave Clause was written into the Constitution by the Founding Fathers specifically to prevent the Federal Government simply seizing the land belonging to the people to sell off, pledge as collateral, or rent!
With open lands for collateral already in short supply, the US Government embarked on a new program to shore up sagging international demand for the dollar. The United States approached the world's oil producing nations, mostly in the Middle East, and offered them a deal. In exchange for only selling their oil for dollars, the United States would guarantee the military safety of those oil-rich nations. The oil rich nations would agree to spend and invest their US paper dollars inside the United States, in particular in US Treasury Bonds, redeemable through the slave labor of future generations of US taxpayers. The concept was labeled the ""petrodollar"". In effect, the US, no longer able to back the dollar with gold, was now backing it with oil. Other peoples' oil. And that necessity to keep control over those oil nations to prop up the dollar has shaped America's foreign policy in the region ever since.
But as America's manufacturing and agriculture has declined, the oil producing nations faced a dilemma. Those piles of US Federal Reserve notes were not able to purchase much from the United States because the United States had little (other than real estate) anyone wanted to buy. Europe's cars and aircraft were superior and less costly, while experiments with GMO food crops led to nations refusing to buy US food exports. Israel's constant belligerence against its neighbors caused them to wonder if the US could actually keep their end of the petrodollar arrangement. Oil producing nations started to talk of selling their oil for whatever currency the purchasers chose to use.
Saddam Hussein and the lie of Iraq's nuclear weapons
Saddam HusseinIraq, already hostile to the United States following Desert Storm, demanded the right to sell their oil for Euros in 2000 and in 2002, the United Nations agreed to allow it under the ""Oil for food"" program instituted following Desert Storm. One year later the United States re-invaded Iraq under the lie of Saddam's nuclear weapons, lynched Saddam Hussein, and placed Iraq's oil back on the world market only for US dollars.
The clear US policy shift following 9-11, away from being an impartial broker of peace in the Mideast to one of unquestioned support for Israel's aggressions only further eroded confidence in the Petrodollar deal and even more oil producing nations started openly talking of oil trade for other global currencies.
Gaddafi and the Gold Dinar
GaddafiOver in Libya, Muammar Gaddafi had instituted a state-owned central bank and a value based trade currency, the Gold Dinar.
The Gold DinarGaddafi announced that Libya's oil was for sale, but only for the Gold Dinar. Other African nations, seeing the rise of the Gold Dinar and the Euro, even as the US dollar continued its inflation-driven decline, flocked to the new Libyan currency for trade. This move had the potential to seriously undermine the global hegemony of the dollar. French President Nicolas Sarkozy reportedly went so far as to call Libya a “threat” to the financial security of the world. So, the United States invaded Libya, brutally murdered Qaddafi ( the object lesson of Saddam's lynching not being enough of a message, apparently), imposed a private central bank, and returned Libya's oil output to dollars only. The gold that was to have been made into the Gold Dinars, 144 tons of it, is as of last report, unaccounted for.
UPDATE: Emails surfacing as part of the investigation into Hilary Clinton's use of a private email server for classified information CONFIRM that the real reason for the US invasion of Libya was to destroy the threat of the Gold Dinar becoming a pan-African currency, displacing the dollar!
General Wesley Clark blows the whistle on US plans to conquer the oil-rich Middle EastAccording to General Wesley Clark, the master plan for the ""dollarification"" of the world's oil nations included seven targets, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran (Venezuela, which dared to sell their oil to China for the Yuan, is a late addition). What is notable about the original seven nations originally targeted by the US is that none of them are members of the Bank for International Settlements, the private central bankers private central bank, located in Switzerland. This meant that these nations were deciding for themselves how to run their nations' economies, rather than submit to the international private banks.
UPDATE: Emails from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released as part of the Benghazi investigation confirm that the true motive for the attack on Libya was to control the Libyan oil reserves and to destroy Libya's gold-backed currency.
Now the bankers' gun sights are on Iran, which dares to have a government central bank and sell their oil for whatever currency they choose. The war agenda is, as always, to force Iran's oil to be sold only for US dollars and to force them to accept a privately owned central bank. Malaysia, one of the few remaining nations without a Rothschild central bank, is now being invaded by a force claimed to be ""Al Qaeda"" and has suffered numerous suspicious losses of its commercial passenger jets.
With the death of President Hugo Chavez, plans to impose a US and banker friendly regime on Venezuela are clearly being implemented.
So, just where is the gold?
Germany's gold bullion. Where is it?The German government recently asked for the return of some of their gold bullion from the Bank of France and the New York Federal Reserve. France has said it will take 5 years to return Germany's gold. The United States has said they will need 8 years to return Germany's gold. This suggests strongly that the Bank of France and the NY Federal Reserve have used the deposited gold for other purposes, most likely to cover gold futures contracts used to artificially suppress the price of gold to keep investors in the equities markets, and the Central Banks are scrambling to find new gold to cover the shortfall and prevent a gold run. So it is inevitable that suddenly France invades Mali, ostensibly to combat Al Qaeda, with the US joining in. Mali just happens to be one of the world's largest gold producers with gold accounting for 80% of Mali exports. War for the bankers does not get more obvious than that!
Mexico has demanded a physical audit of their gold bullion stored at the Bank of England, and along with Venezuela's vast oil reserves (larger than Saudi Arabia), Venezuela's gold mines are a prize lusted after by all the Central Banks that played fast and loose with other peoples' gold bullion. So we can expect regime change if not outright invasion soon.
Can a bank foreclose on your house if they have provided nothing of real value in the mortgage?
A little remembered footnote in banking history occurred in December 1968. A bank was moving to foreclose on a house, and the homeowner decided to fight the foreclosure in court, arguing that contract law requires two contracting parties to agree to swap two items of value, legally called the ""consideration."" In the case of First National Bank of Montgomery vs. Jerome Daly, Daly argued that since the bank simply wrote a number in a ledger to create the loaned money out of think air, there was no real value and therefore no legally binding consideration. The lawyers for the bank admitted that this is how the bank works. They create money out of thin air as a ledger or computer entry, which you must repay with your labor. And there was no law in 1968 that specifically gave banks the legal right to do that. Daly argued that because there was no equal consideration, the mortgage was null and void and the attempt to foreclose invalid. The jury agreed! So did Judge Mahoney, who resisted demands to over-rule the jury in favor of the bank, and wrote a simple streightforward decision that stated that there was no question that the mortgage contract was void because the claim that the bank simply made up the money out of thin air was not disputed by the bank itself.
Judge Mahoney was murdered with poison less than six months later, and the lawyer representing Daly was debarred. The decision in favor of Daly was then nullified on procedural grounds and the entire matter forgotten!
You are BRAINWASHED!
You have been raised by a public school system and media that constantly assures you that the reasons for all these wars and assassinations are many and varied. The US claims to bring democracy to the conquered lands (they haven't; the usual result of a US overthrow is the imposition of a dictatorship, such as the 1953 CIA overthrow of Iran's democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh and the imposition of the Shah, or the 1973 CIA overthrow of Chile's democratically elected government of President Salvador Allende, and the imposition of Augusto Pinochet), or to save a people from a cruel oppressor, revenge for 9-11, or that tired worn-out catch all excuse for invasion, weapons of mass destruction. Assassinations are always passed off as ""crazed lone nuts"" to obscure the real agenda.
The real agenda is simple. It is enslavement of the people by creation of a false sense of obligation. That obligation is false because the Private Central Banking system, by design, always creates more debt than money with which to pay that debt. Private Central Banking is not science, it is a religion; a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the priesthood, meaning the owners of the Private Central Bank. The fraud persists, with often lethal results, because the people are tricked into believing that this is the way life is supposed to be and no alternative exists or should be dreamt of. The same was true of two earlier systems of enslavement, Rule by Divine Right and Slavery, both systems built to trick people into obedience, and both now recognized by modern civilizatyion as illegitimate. Now we are entering a time in human history where we will recognize that rule by debt, or rule by Private Central Bankers issuing the public currency as a loan at interest, is equally illegitimate. It only works as long as people allow themselves to believe that this is the way life is supposed to be.
But understand this above all; Private Central Banks do not exist to serve the people, the community, or the nation. Private Central Banks exist to serve their owners, to make them rich beyond the dreams of Midas and all for the cost of ink, paper, and the right bribe to the right official.
Behind all these wars, all these assassinations, the hundred million horrible deaths from all the wars lies a single policy of dictatorship. The private central bankers allow rulers to rule only on the condition that the people of a nation be enslaved to the private central banks. Failing that, said ruler will be killed, and their nation invaded by those other nations enslaved to private central banks.
The so-called ""clash of civilizations"" we read about on the corporate media is really a war between banking systems, with the private central bankers forcing themselves onto the rest of the world, no matter how many millions must die for it. Indeed the constant hatemongering against Muslims lies in a simple fact. Like the ancient Christians (prior to the Knights Templars private banking system) , Muslims forbid usury, or the lending of money at interest. And that is the reason our government and media insist they must be killed or converted. They refuse to submit to currencies issued at interest. They refuse to be debt slaves.
So off to war your children must go, to spill their blood for the money-junkies' gold. We barely survived the last two world wars. In the nuclear/bioweapon age, are the private central bankers willing to risk incinerating the whole planet just to feed their greed?
Apparently so.
This brings us to the current situation in the Ukraine, Russia, and China.
The European Union had been courting the government of the Ukraine to merge with the EU, and more to the point, entangle their economy with the private-owned European Central Bank. The government of the Ukraine was considering the move, but had made no commitments. Part of their concern lay with the conditions in other EU nations enslaved to the ECB, notably Cyprus, Greece, Spain, and Italy. So they were properly cautious. Then Russia stepped in with a better deal and the Ukraine, exercising the basic choice all consumers have to choose the best product at the best price, dropped the EU and announced they were going to go with Russia's offer. It was at that point that agents provocateurs flooded into the Ukraine, covertly funded by intelligence agency fronts like CANVAS and USAID, stirring up trouble, while the western media proclaimed this was a popular revolution. Snipers shot at people and this violence was blamed on then-President Yanukovich. However a leaked recording of a phone call between the EU's Catherine Ashton and Estonia's Foreign Minister Urmas Paet confirmed the snipers were working for the overthrow plotters, not the Ukrainian government. Urmas Paet has confirmed the authenticity of that phone call.
This is a classic pattern of covert overthrow we have seen many times before. Since the end of WW2, the US has covertly tried to overthrow the governments of 56 nations, succeeding 25 times. Examples include the 1953 overthrow of Iran's elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh and the imposition of the Shah, the 1973 overthrow of Chile's elected government of Salvador Allende and the imposition of the Pinochet dictatorship, and of course, the current overthrow of Ukraine's elected government of Yanukovich and the imposition of the current unelected government, which is already gutting the Ukraine's wealth to hand to the western bankers.
Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa have formed a parallel financial system called BRICS, scheduled to officially launch on January 1, 2015. As of this writing some 80 nations are ready to trade with BRICS in transactions that do not involve the US dollar. Despite US economic warfare against both Russia and China, the Ruble and Yuan are seen as more attractive for international trade and banking than the US dollar, hence the US attempt to fan the Ukraine crisis into war with Russia, and attempts to provoke North Korea as a back door to war with China.
Flag waving and propaganda aside, all modern wars are wars by and for the private bankers, fought and bled for by third parties unaware of the true reason they are expected to gracefully be killed and crippled for. The process is quite simple. As soon as the Private Central Bank issues its currency as a loan at interest, the public is forced deeper and deeper into debt. When the people are reluctant to borrow any more, that is when the Keynesian economists demand the government borrow more to keep the pyramid scheme working. When both the people and government refuse to borrow any more, that is when wars are started, to plunge everyone even deeper into debt to pay for the war, then after the war to borrow more to rebuild. When the war is over, the people have about the same as they did before the war, except the graveyards are far larger and everyone is in debt to the private bankers for the next century. This is why Brown Brothers Harriman in New York was funding the rise of Adolf Hitler.
As long as Private Central Banks are allowed to exist, inevitably as the night follows day there will be poverty, hopelessness, and millions of deaths in endless World Wars, until the Earth itself is sacrificed in flames to Mammon.
The path to true peace on Earth lies in the abolishment of all private central banking everywhere, and a return to the state-issued value-based currencies that allow nations and people to become prosperous.

				Synopsis: The documentary explains the Germans' role in creating Jehad to combat the British Empire in India. And the common hatred Germany & Turkey had against Russia.
The Ottoman Empire entered World War I as one of the Central Powers. The Ottoman Empire joined the war by carrying out a surprise attack on Russia's Black Sea coast on October 29, 1914, with Russia responding by declaring war on November 5, 1914. Ottoman forces fought the Entente in the Balkans and the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. The Ottoman Empire's defeat in the war in 1918 was crucial in the eventual dissolution of the empire in 1922.
⇢ Entry into World War I
Ottoman entry into World War I resulted from two recently purchased ships of its navy, still manned by their German crews and commanded by their German admiral, carrying out the Black Sea Raid on October 29, 1914. Several factors conspired to influence the Ottoman government and encourage them to enter the war. The political reasons for the Ottoman Sultan's entry into the war are disputed, and the Ottoman Empire was an agricultural state in an age of industrial warfare. Also, the empire's economic resources were depleted by the cost of the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. The reasons for the Ottoman action were not immediately clear.
⇢ Military
The Ottoman entry into World War I began on October 29, 1914, when it launched the Black Sea Raid against Russian ports. Following the attack, Russia and its allies (Britain and France) declared war on the Ottomans in November 1914. The Ottoman Empire started military action after three months of formal neutrality, but it had signed a secret alliance with the Central Powers in August 1914.
The great landmass of Anatolia was between the Ottoman army's headquarters in Constantinople and many of the theatres of war. During Abdul Hamid II's reign, civilian communications had improved, but the road and rail network was not ready for war. It took more than a month to reach Syria and nearly two months to reach Mesopotamia. The railway ran only 60 km east of Ankara to reach the border with Russia, and from there, it was 35 days to Erzurum. The Army used Trabzon port as a logistical shortcut to the east. It took less time to arrive at any of those fronts from London than from the Ottoman War Department because of the poor condition of Ottoman supply ships.
The empire fell into disorder with the declaration of war along with Germany. On November 11, a conspiracy was discovered in Constantinople against Germans and the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) in which some of the CUP leaders were shot. That followed the November 12 revolt in Adrianople against the German military mission. On November 13, a bomb exploded in Enver Pasha's palace, which killed five German officers but failed to kill Enver Pasha. On November 18, there were more anti-German plots. Committees formed around the country to rid the country of those who sided with Germany. Army and navy officers protested against the assumption of authority by Germans. On December 4, widespread riots took place throughout the country. On December 13, an anti-war demonstration was led by women in Konak (Izmir) and Erzurum. Throughout December, the CUP dealt with a mutiny among soldiers in barracks and naval crews. The head of the German Military Mission, Field Marshal von der Goltz, survived a conspiracy against his life.
Military power remained firmly in the hands of War Minister Enver Pasha, domestic issues (civil matters) were under Interior Minister Talat Pasha, and, interestingly, Cemal Pasha had sole control over Ottoman Syria. Provincial governors ran their regions with differing degrees of autonomy. An interesting case is Izmir; Rahmi Bey behaved almost like his region was a neutral zone between the warring states.
⇢ War with Russia
The Ottoman's entrance into the war significantly increased the Triple Entente's military burdens. Russia had to fight alone in the Caucasus Campaign but clashed with the United Kingdom in the Persian Campaign. İsmail Enver Pasha set off for the Battle of Sarikamish to recapture Batum and Kars, overrunning Georgia and occupying north-western Persia and the oil fields. Fighting the Russians in the Caucasus, however, the Ottomans lost ground, and over 100,000 soldiers, in a series of battles. 60,000 Ottoman soldiers died in the winter of 1916–17 on the Mus—Bitlis section of the front. The Ottomans preferred to keep the Caucasus militarily silent as they had to regroup reserves to retake Baghdad and Palestine from the British. 1917 and the first half of 1918 were the time for negotiations. On December 5, 1917, the armistice of Erzincan (Erzincan Cease-fire Agreement) was signed between the Russians and Ottomans in Erzincan, ending the armed conflicts between Russia and Ottoman Empire. On March 3, the Grand vizier Talat Pasha signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Russian SFSR. It stipulated that Bolshevik Russia cede Batum, Kars, and Ardahan. In addition to these provisions, a secret clause was inserted that obligated the Russians to demobilize Armenian national forces.
From March 14 to April 1918, the Trabzon peace conference was held between the Ottoman Empire and the delegation of the Transcaucasian Diet. Enver Pasha offered to surrender all ambitions in the Caucasus in return for recognition of the Ottoman reacquisition of the east Anatolian provinces at Brest-Litovsk at the end of the negotiations. On April 5, the head of the Transcaucasian delegation Akaki Chkhenkeli accepted the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a basis for more negotiations and wired the governing bodies urging them to accept this position. However, the mood prevailing in Tiflis was very different. Tiflis acknowledge the existence of a state of war between themselves and the Ottoman Empire.
In April 1918, the Ottoman 3rd Army finally went on the offensive in Armenia. Opposition from Armenian forces led to the Battle of Sardarapat, the Battle of Kara Killisse, and the Battle of Bash Abaran. On May 28, 1918, the Armenian National Council based in Tiflis declared the First Republic of Armenia. The new Republic of Armenia was forced to sign the Treaty of Batum.
In July 1918, the Ottomans faced the Centrocaspian Dictatorship at the Battle of Baku, intending to take Armenian/Russian/British-occupied Baku on the Caspian Sea.
⇢ War with Britain
The British captured Basra in November 1914 and marched north into Iraq. Initially, Ahmed Djemal Pasha was ordered to gather an army in Palestine to threaten the Suez Canal. In response, the Allies—including the newly formed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (""ANZACs"")—opened another front with the Battle of Gallipoli. The Army led by Ahmed Djemal Pasha (Fourth Army) to eject the British from Egypt was stopped at the Suez Canal in February 1915 and again the following summer. The canal was vital to the British war effort. In addition, the 1915 locust plague broke out in Palestine; the Ottoman military hospitals recorded the period as March–October 1915.
The expected and feared British invasion came not through Cilicia or northern Syria but through the straits. The Dardanelles campaign aimed to support Russia. Most military observers recognized that the uneducated Ottoman soldier was lost without good leadership. At Gallipoli, Mustafa Kemal realized the capabilities of his men if their officers led from the front. The war was something from a different era, as the agrarian Ottoman Empire faced two industrialized forces; in silent predawn attacks, officers with drawn swords went ahead of the troops, and the troops shouted their battle cry of ""Allahu Akbar!"" when they reached the enemy's trenches.
Great Britain was obliged to defend India and the southern Persian oil territory by undertaking the Mesopotamian campaign. Britain also had to protect Egypt in the Sinai-Palestine-Syria Campaign. These campaigns strained Allied resources and relieved Germany.
The repulse of British forces in Palestine in the spring of 1917 was followed by the loss of Jerusalem in December of the same year. The Ottoman authorities deported the entire civilian population of Jaffa, according to orders from Ahmet Cemal, on April 6, 1917. While the Muslim evacuees were allowed to return shortly after, the Jewish deportees could not until after the war. The events co-occurred with the formation of the Balfour Declaration (published on November 2, 1917), in which the British Government declared its support for establishing a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine.
The Ottomans were eventually defeated due to scathing attacks by British general Edmund Allenby.
⇢ Foreign relations
The Ottoman–German Alliance, was ratified on August 2, 1914, shortly following the outbreak of World War I. The alliance was created as part of a joint-cooperative effort to strengthen and modernize the failing Ottoman military and provide Germany safe passage into neighboring British colonies.

This out-of-touch ad highlights Warnock's desperation and lack of care for the people of Georgia and their families. Based on recent inflation numbers, we already know that Thanksgiving is going to cost Georgia families the most it has in decades thanks to Raphael Warnock's blind loyalty to Joe Biden's reckless spending agenda. September's inflation report shows double-digit increases for most of the dishes that make up a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, the typical Thanksgiving dinner includes the staples of a 16-pound turkey, a gallon of milk, potatoes, ham, and dinner rolls. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show: An 8- to 16-pound turkey cost $1.99/lb last week, up from $1.15 a year ago, nearly a 75% increase Boneless ham has increased 13.6% in September from a year ago to $5.50/lb White potatoes have spiked 27.7% to $1.02/lb White bread has climbed 10.7% to $1.75/lb A gallon of whole milk has surged 16.6% to $4.18 Canned fruits and vegetables are up 19% Chicken is up 17.2% A wide range of miscellaneous ingredients has also increased at a significant rate over the last year, including: Butter is up 26.6% Flour is up 24.4% Spices and seasoning are up 13.8% Sugar is up 17.1% Sauces and gravies are up 16.3% Coffee is up 15.7% Eggs are up 30.5% Overall, food prices have soared over the last year, with the BLS food index climbing at an annualized pace of 11.2%. Grocery store prices spiked 13% year-over-year in September, while the cost of visiting a restaurant has risen 8.5% compared to the same time a year ago. “Countless Georgians won't be able to afford Thanksgiving dinner this year due to Raphael Warnock's reckless voting record in Washington,"" said campaign spokesman Will Kiley. ""His blind loyalty to Joe Biden has hurt Georgia families and given us historic inflation and empty grocery stores, but what is Warnock's response? Make an out-of-touch and expensive commercial in a desperate attempt to save his campaign. The only way we can stop this out-of-control inflation is by electing Herschel Walker to the U.S. Senate and removing Raphael Warnock from office.""", ,no longer populated,,2022-10-26T16:29:19.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT2FMWmdNPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a4fffef29005114ab4779ee47356492748e01b08/post-9712755-71268255-thumbnail,13,5,1,0,,

How FEMA is Helping Floridians FEMA has made individual assistance available to 24 counties in Florida. Residents in Brevard, Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Flagler, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Lee, Manatee, Monroe, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns and Volusia counties are eligible to apply for individual assistance. FEMA is meeting survivors where they are to help jumpstart their recoveries. Disaster Survivor Assistance specialists are going door-to-door in Florida neighborhoods to help individuals register for assistance. These teams have interacted with 22,000 individuals. Survivors can visit one of 13 Disaster Recovery Centers operating in Charlotte, Collier, Hardee, Highlands, Lake, Lee (2 centers), Orange, Osceola, Polk, Sarasota, Seminole and Volusia counties. More centers are planned to open in the coming days. Interpretation services and translated materials are available at these centers to help survivors communicate in the language they feel most comfortable. Disaster Recovery Center locations are chosen for their accessibility, with the goal of reaching as many people as possible. As centers are added, real-time locations will be updated at FloridaDisaster.org. FEMA will pay hotel and motel costs for eligible survivors. FEMA and the state of Florida activated the Transitional Sheltering Assistance Program, which allows FEMA to make payments directly to participating hotels and motels in Alabama, Florida and Georgia that provide emergency shelter to survivors. As of today, the program is providing housing for 1,062 households with 2,716 members. Hundreds of FEMA inspectors have performed over 56,500 home inspections for survivors who registered for federal disaster assistance. The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved $40 million in low-interest disaster loans to homeowners, renters and business owners. Business Recovery Centers are located in Collier, DeSoto, Hillsborough, Lee and Seminole counties. As of Oct. 14, FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has received more than 37,000 flood insurance claims and paid more than $55 million to policyholders, including $39 million in advance payments. NFIP policyholders may receive up to $1,000 to reimburse the purchase of supplies like sandbags, plastic sheeting and lumber. They may also receive up to $1,000 in storage expenses if they moved insured property. Policyholders should file a claim for flood loss avoidance reimbursement, regardless of if it was successful in preventing flood damage. Disaster Unemployment Assistance is available to eligible survivors. Floridians can file a claim for loss of income caused by Hurricane Ian by going to Disaster Unemployment Assistance - FloridaJobs.org and selecting “Apply for Hurricane Ian DUA,” visiting a local CareerSource Career Center, or calling 800-385-3920. Customer service representatives are available Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET. Low-income Florida residents recovering from Hurricane Ian may be eligible for assistance from the Department of Agriculture’s Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP). Survivors can find more information on Florida’s D-SNAP program by visiting the Florida Department of Children and Families’ Hurricane Ian Response & Recovery website. Operation Blue Roof has installed 409 roofs in Lee and Charlotte counties. This is a free service provided to homeowners and is currently operating in Charlotte, Collier, Desoto, Lee and Sarasota counties. Residents impacted by Hurricane Ian can sign up at BlueRoof.us or call toll-free at 1-888-ROOF-BLU (1-888-766-3258) for more information. The call center will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. National Flood Insurance Program Florida policyholders who had flood damage from the hurricane now have a 90-day window to renew their policies. The extension applies to policies with renewal dates beginning Aug. 25 through Oct. 23. Policyholders whose policy renewal date is in this range should contact their agent or insurance company. FEMA also extended the proof of loss requirement for flood insurance policyholders in Florida who experienced flood damage from Hurricane Ian from 60 to 365 days. For more information on how to file a flood insurance claim, visit How to Start Your Flood Insurance Claim. FEMA approved Critical Needs Assistance for disaster survivors with immediate or critical needs because they are displaced from their primary dwelling. Immediate or critical needs are life-saving and life-sustaining items. This assistance is a one-time payment of $700 per household. If you or a member of your household uses adaptive or accessibility items that were damaged by Hurricane Ian, you may be eligible for FEMA assistance for those items.

On September 20, the feds charged 47 people in Minnesota with looting $250 million from the federal child nutrition programs’ COVID aid. Prosecutors denounced the “brazen scheme of staggering proportions,” but federal and state bureaucrats should have stopped the pilfering from the start. “Feeding Our Future,” a nonprofit organization, pocketed $300,000 in subsidies in 2018 and a windfall of almost $200 million in 2021. Fraud snowballed because the US Department of Agriculture issued waivers to “suspend all on-site monitoring of providers” of children’s meals. Instead of feeding hungry kids, tax dollars were pilfered using a list of phony recipients generated by the website listofrandomnames.com. (No wonder Feeding Our Future wasn’t invited to attend Biden’s White House Summit on Hunger last week.) When the state of Minnesota sought to cut off funding, Feeding Our Future sued, claiming the action “discriminated against a nonprofit that worked with racial minorities,” the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Leftist firebrand Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) received thousands of dollars in donations from individuals indicted in the scandal. Fighting fraud is tricky for federal investigators when some politicians openly used COVID stimulus money to bribe voters. In the January 2021 Georgia runoff race for US Senate, the campaign of Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock distributed fliers declaring, “Want a $2,000 Check? Vote Warnock.” That promise helped Warnock win, sealing Democratic control of the Senate and opening the floodgates for trillions of dollars of additional Biden administration spending. The single biggest COVID fraud will never show up in triumphal press releases issued by federal prosecutors. On August 24, Biden invoked the COVID-19 emergency to justify canceling $400 billion in student loans. A few weeks ago, Biden told 60 Minutes that the pandemic was over — thus invalidating his justification for loan forgiveness. But Team Biden signaled that it was entitled to spend hundreds of billions of tax dollars to purchase Democratic votes in the midterm congressional elections regardless of the president’s admission. Plenty of scoundrels will be convicted in the coming months for stealing COVID money. But it was the politicians of both parties who unleashed the reckless spending that left us with a soaring national debt, roaring inflation, and a fading mirage of prosperity.” https://brownstone.org/articles/covid-fraud-a-staggering-600-billion/", ,no longer populated,,2022-10-14T13:58:44.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSUFJZlFJPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0568c1d544c9c39c2f5db08bcc86c4a3ab7fe4f1/post-5568468-63267543-thumbnail,0,0,0,0,,

Over the last 16 months we have brought every single candidate to our meetings or events and have done everything possible to help our members and the public actually get to meet and hear from the candidates and to highlight their conservative views and positions. When you consider that Stacey Abrams herself trash talked careers in agriculture and tourism, essentially throwing our county under the bus if she were ever elected to Georgia's highest office and you consider the fact that our two current United States Senators and their staffs have virtually ignored Rabun County since being elected in 2021 with no help on our priorities like rural broadband access, it is absolutely clear that we need new leadership in the United States Senate from the state of Georgia. Richard Woods for State School Superintendent has been to our county over a dozen times since being first elected and has truly engaged with us to learn about our needs. He has served as a County superintendent in several Georgia school systems and he is deeply committed to school excellence while opposing any efforts to introduce things like critical race theory or the 1619 project into our local schools. Bruce Thompson is exactly the right person to take over a troubled agency that lost focus during the covid-19 shut down. He will be more responsive and make sure that the Georgia Department of labor's offices are effectively handling case management so that Georgians can work and our local businesses can find the labor that is in such short supply right now. Bruce is from Cartersville Georgia but he has already been to our County three times seeking our votes. He currently serves in the Georgia Senate and is a small business owner himself. Brad Raffensperger has been a true friend to Rabun County as our incumbent Secretary of State. He has been here a number of times and when he launched his campaign four years ago for this office his very first bus stop on his statewide tour was at our Rock House. He actually set up a zoom conference just for Rabun County to talk about election integrity 2 years ago. We were very proud to be one of the very few County Republican parties who can honestly say that we had all four candidates for Secretary of State during the primary season. He pushed hard for election integrity Senate Bill 202 and when Stacey Abrams and her Fair action fight group took Brad to court she lost her entire case this past week and that was from a ruling by a judge appointed by President Obama. We call on the Georgia Republican Party to fully support all Republicans on the Georgia ballot. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was just in Rabun County this past week at the courthouse meeting with our officials and the public. He understands that we value our law enforcement, that we went to fully fund our local police, and that we want to live in a peaceful and crime free Mountain community. He was @Senator Johnny Isakson's chief of staff and he carries those same values in his current office. Commissioner John King is Georgia's first Hispanic statewide official and as a general in the Georgia National guard he served honorably in Afghanistan and as the Doraville Police Chief he understands that every homeowner wants to make sure that investment in their home is always protected. Commissioner King also took over a troubled agency when Governor Brian Kemp appointed him. General King came to Rabun County during the primary season and we appreciate his service and his many years in the Georgia National guard. Tyler Harper is a 7th generation farmer from Ocilla Georgia. Our own Bo Hatchett for State Senate brought Tyler to Rabun County to take him on a tour of the many agricultural related businesses we have in our county. Both Tyler and Bo have served in the state senate and are deeply committed to agriculture which is one of the economic engines of Rabun County. Tyler also has a long history of working with groups like 4-H and Future Farmers of America and as our new agriculture education center comes online with the ribbon coating this week, he is the right person to take over this vital agency. Burt Jones is running for lieutenant governor. He operates Jones petroleum which has a network of several hundred convenience stores across the state and he used to play football for the University of Georgia. He also serves in the Georgia Senate and he hails from the small town of Jackson in Butts County Georgia. Herschel Walker is a Heisman trophy winner and a football legend at the University of Georgia and is running for the United States Senate in a critical race that all of the pundits have said is one of the closest races in the nation.

Higher prices and shortages are likely for fruit and vegetables and other produce from the glasshouses of Europe,where the heat has been turned down because of the steep inflation in natural gas prices.
In particular, the supply of these crops is likely to fall from the Netherlands,where an estimated 2.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year (about 8% of the country’s consumption of the fuel)is needed to heat 25,000 acres of high-yielding glasshouses, which help to make the country the world’s second-largest exporter of food, by value.
Food Price Outlook, 2022
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings.aspx
Here's how much food prices are going to rise in 2022
https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-food-grocery-prices-increase
As inflation jumps, here's a look at how much more Americans are paying for food and fuel
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-gas-food-prices-increase/
As European gas prices increased 985% year-on-year, to a record high level in December, Dutch glasshouse owners turned down the heat needed to grow crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and flowers.
Meanwhile, many British glasshouse growers didn’t go ahead with their normal January crop plantings, because of high gas prices, and the lack of workers.
At the other side of Europe, there are reports that about 70% of all Bulgarian greenhouses for vegetable production didn’t produce crops this winter due to high gas prices,leading to a lack of home-produced tomatoes and cucumbers on their domestic market.
Greenhouse owners in some other EU countries have depended on state aid to continue production.
The seismic move toward omitting some gas appliances comes as the California Energy Commission retools state building codes for energy-efficient homes.It's an expansion of the state's first-in-the-nation mandates requiring solar panels on all new homes starting last year.
The agency now plans to tighten rules on natural gas for home heating and hot water, a code update that would take effect in 2023.
Environmental groups want a complete ban on natural gas in new homes,but the state commission has signaled that isn't likely right now. Officials instead in the coming months are likely to use incentives to urge developers to pick electric options for heating, like heat pumps. More muscular requirements could come later.
The long-term outlook for natural gas isn't good in California, which wants to eliminate most carbon emissions by 2045.

worldwide' shortage of urea is even more 'frightening' than we realize because it is has so many uses beyond transport.
What’s Driving Urea Supply Shortages and What Experts Expect with DEF Pricing
https://www.sclubricants.com/whats-driving-urea-supply-shortages-and-what-experts-expect-with-def-pricing/
High Demand Among Agriculture, Factory Shutdowns Leading to Higher PricesIn the early months of 2021, experts stated that spikes in urea prices were driven by greater demand in the agriculture industry and more prevalent use among diesel-engine vehicles.Although price increases during the spring planting season isn’t uncommon, the 2021 spikes came earlier and have occurred more frequently than the past seven years.
As a direct result, experts predict increases for Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) will follow suit, much as they have this year as prices for finished lubricants have hit.
Composed of 32.5% urea and 67.5% de-ionized water, DEF is injected into the exhaust stream of diesel engines, breaking down harmful NOx emissions into nitrogen and water vapor. Because of its high content with urea, and the higher quality of urea it takes to manufacture DEF, the prices of urea most often drive the cost of DEF.
“Not only will fertilizer be delayed by these shipping restrictions, but additional fertilizer needed to complete spring applications may be unable to reach farmers at all. By placing this arbitrary restriction on just a handful of shippers, Union Pacific is jeopardizing farmers’ harvests and increasing the cost of food for consumers.”
CF Industries informed its customers located on UP that railroad-mandated shipping reductions would result in nitrogen fertilizer shipment delays during the spring application season. The company also informed customers that it would be unable to accept new rail sales involving UP for the foreseeable future.
UP on April 8 told CF Industries that it would have to reduce its shipments by nearly 20% as part of the railroad’s plan to reduce congestion in the midst of crew and locomotive shortages.
CF Industries said it will ask the Surface Transportation Board to intervene so that fertilizer shipments are prioritized.
“CF Industries’ North American manufacturing network continues to produce at a high rate to meet the needs of customers, farmers and consumers,” Will said. “We urge the federal government to take action to remove these Union Pacific rail shipment restrictions to ensure this vital fertilizer will be able to reach U.S. farmers when and where they need it.”
The fertilizer company said it was one of only 30 shippers to face restrictions designed to unclog the UP network. CF Industries ships to customers via Union Pacific rail lines primarily from its Donaldsonville Complex in Louisiana and its Port Neal Complex in Iowa. The rail lines serve key agricultural areas such as Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, and California.
Affected products include nitrogen fertilizers such as urea and urea ammonium nitrate, as well as diesel exhaust fluid, an emissions control product required for diesel trucks.CF Industries is the largest producer of all three products in North America, and its Donaldsonville Complex is the largest single production facility for the products in North America.
CF Industries says crop yields will be lower this year if farmers are unable to secure all the nitrogen fertilizer that they need. This will likely extend the timeline to replenish global grains stocks and contribute to higher food prices, the company contends.
UP sent an email to customers earlier this month outlining the railroad’s goal of removing 15,000 private cars from current inventory.UP is pulling nearly 3% of railroad-owned cars from the system. The railroad has said it will work with customers to avoid plant shutdowns and other potential negative impacts.

Higher prices and shortages are likely for fruit and vegetables and other produce from the glasshouses of Europe,where the heat has been turned down because of the steep inflation in natural gas prices.
In particular, the supply of these crops is likely to fall from the Netherlands,where an estimated 2.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year (about 8% of the country’s consumption of the fuel)is needed to heat 25,000 acres of high-yielding glasshouses, which help to make the country the world’s second-largest exporter of food, by value.
Food Price Outlook, 2022

Here's how much food prices are going to rise in 2022

As inflation jumps, here's a look at how much more Americans are paying for food and fuel
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-gas-food-prices-increase/
As European gas prices increased 985% year-on-year, to a record high level in December, Dutch glasshouse owners turned down the heat needed to grow crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and flowers.
Meanwhile, many British glasshouse growers didn’t go ahead with their normal January crop plantings, because of high gas prices, and the lack of workers.
At the other side of Europe, there are reports that about 70% of all Bulgarian greenhouses for vegetable production didn’t produce crops this winter due to high gas prices,leading to a lack of home-produced tomatoes and cucumbers on their domestic market.
Greenhouse owners in some other EU countries have depended on state aid to continue production.
The seismic move toward omitting some gas appliances comes as the California Energy Commission retools state building codes for energy-efficient homes.It's an expansion of the state's first-in-the-nation mandates requiring solar panels on all new homes starting last year.
The agency now plans to tighten rules on natural gas for home heating and hot water, a code update that would take effect in 2023.
Environmental groups want a complete ban on natural gas in new homes,but the state commission has signaled that isn't likely right now. Officials instead in the coming months are likely to use incentives to urge developers to pick electric options for heating, like heat pumps. More muscular requirements could come later.
The long-term outlook for natural gas isn't good in California, which wants to eliminate most carbon emissions by 2045.

Higher prices and shortages are likely for fruit and vegetables and other produce from the glasshouses of Europe,where the heat has been turned down because of the steep inflation in natural gas prices.
In particular, the supply of these crops is likely to fall from the Netherlands,where an estimated 2.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year (about 8% of the country’s consumption of the fuel)is needed to heat 25,000 acres of high-yielding glasshouses, which help to make the country the world’s second-largest exporter of food, by value.
Food Price Outlook, 2022
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings.aspx
Here's how much food prices are going to rise in 2022
https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-food-grocery-prices-increase
As inflation jumps, here's a look at how much more Americans are paying for food and fuel
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-gas-food-prices-increase/
As European gas prices increased 985% year-on-year, to a record high level in December, Dutch glasshouse owners turned down the heat needed to grow crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and flowers.
Meanwhile, many British glasshouse growers didn’t go ahead with their normal January crop plantings, because of high gas prices, and the lack of workers.
At the other side of Europe, there are reports that about 70% of all Bulgarian greenhouses for vegetable production didn’t produce crops this winter due to high gas prices,leading to a lack of home-produced tomatoes and cucumbers on their domestic market.
Greenhouse owners in some other EU countries have depended on state aid to continue production.
The seismic move toward omitting some gas appliances comes as the California Energy Commission retools state building codes for energy-efficient homes.It's an expansion of the state's first-in-the-nation mandates requiring solar panels on all new homes starting last year.
The agency now plans to tighten rules on natural gas for home heating and hot water, a code update that would take effect in 2023.
Environmental groups want a complete ban on natural gas in new homes,but the state commission has signaled that isn't likely right now. Officials instead in the coming months are likely to use incentives to urge developers to pick electric options for heating, like heat pumps. More muscular requirements could come later.
The long-term outlook for natural gas isn't good in California, which wants to eliminate most carbon emissions by 2045.

Documents ➡️ https://disk.yandex.ru/d/ndINmQKPfDRM0w

Briefing slides ➡️ https://disk.yandex.ru/d/Y8zIZLLNV6M9Fg

▫️The Russian Defence Ministry continues to study materials received from employees of Ukrainian laboratories on the implementation of military biological programs of the United States and its NATO allies on the territory of Ukraine.

▫️Western mass media and some biologists, who most often have a second American citizenship, express doubts about the reliability of the materials published by us. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the documents have the signatures of real officials and are certified by the seals of organizations.

▫️We believe that components of biological weapons were created on the territory of Ukraine.

▫️Here is a document dated March 6, 2015, confirming the Pentagon's direct participation in the financing of military biological projects in Ukraine.

▫️According to established practice, American projects in the field of sanitation in third countries, including in Africa and Asia, are funded through national health authorities.

▫️I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the agreement on joint biological activities was concluded between the US Military Department and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. However, the real recipient of funds are the laboratories of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence located in Kiev, Odessa, Lvov and Kharkov. The total funding amounted to $32 million.

▫️It is no coincidence that these biolabs were chosen by the US Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the contractor company Black & Veatch as the executors of the U-P-8 project aimed at studying the pathogens of the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and hantaviruses. The corresponding request of the Pentagon to involve Ukrainian laboratories for the implementation of the project is presented on the slide. From our point of view, the interest of US military biologists is due to the fact that these pathogens have natural foci both on the territory of Ukraine and in Russia, and their use can be disguised as natural outbreaks of diseases. That is why this project has received additional funding, and the terms of its implementation have been extended.

▫️A study of the documents in the part of the P-781 project on the study of ways of transmitting diseases to humans through bats showed that the work was carried out on the basis of a laboratory in Kharkov together with the infamous R. Lugar Center in Tbilisi. The total costs of the Pentagon for its implementation in Ukraine and Georgia amounted to $ 1.6 million, most of which was received by Ukraine as the main contractor.

▫️The documents received by the Russian Ministry of Defence indicate that research in this area is systematic and has been conducted since at least 2009 under the direct supervision of specialists from the United States within the framework of projects P-382, P-444 and P-568. One of the curators of this activity was the head of the DTRA office at the US Embassy in Kiev, Joanna Wintrall. Maybe journalists should talk to her?

▫️During the implementation of these projects, six families of viruses (including coronaviruses) and three types of pathogenic bacteria (pathogens of plague, brucellosis and leptospirosis) were identified. This is due to the main characteristics of these pathogens that make them favourable for the purposes of infection: resistance to drugs, rapid speed of spread from animals to humans, etc.
▫️It is necessary to note a number of documents confirming the transfer of bioassays selected in Ukraine to the territory of third countries, including Germany, Great Britain, Georgia.

▫️Here are official documents confirming the transfer of five thousand samples of blood serum of Ukrainian citizens to the R. Lugar Center affiliated with the Pentagon in Tbilisi, 773 bioassays were transferred to the reference laboratory of Great Britain. An agreement has been signed for the export of unlimited quantities of infectious materials to the Leffler Institute in Germany.

▫️An analysis of the information received indicates that Ukrainian specialists are not aware of the potential risks of transferring biomaterials, are being used essentially blindly, and have no real idea of the true purpose of the research being conducted.

▫️I would like to draw attention to outbreaks of economically significant diseases on the territory of the Russian Federation. In 2021 alone, the damage from highly pathogenic avian influenza exceeded 1.7 billion rubles, and 6 million heads of poultry were destroyed. At the same time, in European countries, the losses of the agricultural industry from it amounted to about 2.0 billion. euro.

▫️Within the framework of the FLU-FLYWAY project, the Kharkov Institute of Veterinary Medicine studied wild birds as vectors for the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza. At the same time, the conditions under which spread processes can become unmanageable, cause economic damage and pose risks to food security have been assessed.

▫️These documents confirm the involvement of the Kharkov Institute in the collection of avian influenza virus strains with high epidemic potential and capable of overcoming the interspecific barrier. The activities of this institute should be the subject of an international investigation.
Information continues to be received about attempts to destroy biomaterials and documentation in laboratories in Ukraine.

▫️We know that during the liquidation measures in the laboratory of veterinary medicine in Khlebodarskoye, working employees (citizens of Ukraine) were not even allowed into the building! This laboratory cooperates with Anti-Plague Research Institute named after Mechnikov in Odessa, which conducts research with pathogens of plague, anthrax, cholera, tularemia, arboviruses.

▫️In an attempt to cover their tracks, biological waste from the laboratory in Khlebodarskoye was taken 120 km away towards the western border to the area of Tarutino and Berezino settlements. All these facts are recorded by the Ministry of Defence for subsequent legal assessment.

▫️It is necessary to mention the emergency destruction of documents in  Kherson biological laboratory.

▫️One of the reasons for such a rush may be the concealment of information about the outbreak of dirofilariasis, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, that occurred in Kherson in 2018. The question arises why four cases of infection were detected in February, which is unusual for the life cycle of these insects. In April 2018, representatives of the Pentagon visited local healthcare institutions, where they got acquainted with the results of the epidemiological investigation and copied medical documentation.

▫️However, no documentary evidence has been found concerning this outbreak in Kherson laboratory. Proceeding from this, we believe that the urgency of destroying such documentary evidence is explained by the desire to prevent them from getting to Russian specialists.
▫️In addition, attention is drawn to the fact of a sharp increase in cases of tuberculosis caused by new multi-resistant strains among citizens living in Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics in 2018. These data are confirmed by specialists of Rospotrebnadzor. During the mass outbreak recorded in the area of Peski settlement, more than 70 cases of the disease were detected, which ended in a rapid fatal outcome. This may indicate a deliberate infection, or an accidental leakage of the pathogen from one of the biolabs located on the territory of Ukraine.

▫️In accordance with the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons, the participating States submit to the UN information about objects and ongoing biological activities.

▫️These are Confidence-building measures that are published in order to monitor the implementation of the Convention. Since 2016 - the moment of the beginning of the implementation of the projects mentioned by us (including UP-4, UP-8 and P-781), the USA and Ukraine have been deliberately silent about them in international reporting, despite their obvious military-biological orientation.

▫️Such secrecy is another reason to think about the true goals of the Pentagon in Ukraine.

▫️I would like to remind you of the historical facts when such irresponsible activities of the United States outside of national jurisdiction ended only with formal apologies from the American administration. So, in October 2010, US President Obama acknowledged the fact of conducting illegal research on Guatemalan citizens who were intentionally infected with syphilis and gonorrhea pathogens with the approval of the White House.

▫️The Russian Federation has repeatedly called for the publication of data on the military biological activities of the Pentagon on the territory of third countries, but the collective West, led by the United States, consistently blocks this initiative, preferring to conduct research bypassing international obligations with ""someone else's hands"".

▫️We will continue to study the evidence and inform the world community about the illegal activities of the Pentagon and other US government agencies in Ukraine.", ,no longer populated,,2022-03-17T13:56:13.000Z,post data removed,,,,0,0,,

More information: https://agr.georgia.gov/Data/Sites/1/media/ag_animalindustry/animal_health/files/Rabbit-Hemorrhagic-Disease-Virus-Updated-01-24-2022.pdf On January 13, 2022, RHDV-2 was confirmed in a wild cottontail rabbit in Chaffee County in central Colorado, per an updated listing on the Colorado Department of Agriculture website: https://ag.colorado.gov/animals/livestock-health/rabbit-hemorrhagic-disease-virus-rhdv2 As of now, there have been confirmed RHDV2 cases in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as in Canada and Mexico, affecting both wild and domestic rabbits. Officials report a death rate of about 90%, which is why House Rabbit Society encourages rabbit guardians to vaccinate their rabbits. Even indoor-only rabbits are at risk of RHDV2, since the virus can be transferred to them by people (on their shoes and clothes), other animals (including dogs and cats, especially if they go outside), and even insects. The most important thing you can do to protect your rabbit is to get them vaccinated, in areas the vaccine is available (the Medgene RHDV2 vaccine is available in 43 states and Washington, D.C.). The vaccine is safe and effective. So far, Medgene safety testing studies report only rare instances of swelling at the injection site which resolve within 48 hours. Other possible side effects are a temporary slight fever and/or lethargy for 1-2 days. House Rabbit Society continually updates rabbit.org/rhdv with the best information about RHDV2.

The human trafficking scheme, called “Operation Bloom,” exploited hundreds of people and forced them to work in slave-like conditions. Some were smuggled into Georgia from Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras to do “agricultural work."" But the Department of Justice (DOJ) reports that the victims were forced to perform tasks such as digging for onions only using their bare hands. Some victims stated that if they refused to perform specific tasks they were threatened with gun violence, and said they were forced to live in inhumane camps with little to no access to food and drinking water. Traffickers confiscated passports and documents to keep victims in bondage, and in some cases even sold workers to co-conspirators, authorities say. The DOJ stated that at least two workers were allegedly killed and several others were repeatedly raped and kidnapped. According to multiple US agencies, investigations into the trafficking ring started in November 2018.

hall event i'm honored to represent georgia's second congressional district which covers 29 counties across middle and southwest georgia it is home to our columbus macon and albany metropolitan areas as well as their surrounding suburban communities but it also includes many rural communities our district demonstrates the interconnected relationship that urban suburban and rural areas share across the united states it's important to remember that while our rural communities face unique challenges they touch the lives of all americans regardless of where they live today we have leaders from the united states department of agriculture rural development agency rural development's mission is to improve the economy and quality of life in rural america they do so through many programs some of which you will learn about tonight in congress i am a senior member of the house appropriations committee and chair of the subcommittee on agriculture rural development federal drug administration and related agencies in that role i lead the effort in the u s house of representatives to ensure that usda rural development programs receive robust funding each year for this coming fiscal year for example we provided over 727 million dollars for rural water and waste disposal programs in the house past appropriations bill which includes over 20 million dollars for the circuit rider program and 538.3 million dollars for the water and waste disposal loans and grants program for agricultural producers and other small business owners we provided 14 million dollars for the value-added producer grant program and eight million dollars for the rural micro entrepreneur assistance program while i've worked hard over the years to make sure that these programs are well-funded i'm equally committed to making sure that you are aware of these programs as well as connecting you with the departments and agencies that run them also joining us this evening are participants in some of these usda rural development programs i've invited them to join us so that they can share their experience in applying for and working with usda tonight i hope you learn about one or more of these federal programs that may be useful to you and that you are inspired by the success of others also apply on behalf of your farm your business or your community without further ado let me introduce our first speaker from the united states department of agriculture justin maxson is the deputy under secretary for rural development in this role he is responsible for the oversight of the rural development mission areas including the organization and implementation of rural development programs and policies he has an extensive history working as a leader in community organizations and foundations promoting private public partnerships to facilitate economic development and combat poverty in appalachia and across america he was on the founding board of the center for rural strategies i was glad to join deputy under secretary maxon in buena vista georgia in september when the usda announced a grant and loan award to the city of buena vista through one of the programs we will be learning more about tonight i know he's going to talk about it as well so let me just turn it over to deputy under secretary maxon uh it's exciting to be here tonight and we're pleased to have an opportunity to speak to your constituents about the programs that we offer uh we appreciate your long long-standing support for the department and for rural development in particular uh you have brought a vision and a commitment to rural communities and what's possible there uh and uh and the support that your committee has enabled for things like clean water and housing and community facilities and broadband just to name a few have meant uh i think really good things for uh i think for rural communities across the country in addition to southwest georgia i think uh conversations like this showcase the importance of partnerships and we're uh extremely glad at rural development uh to be a proud partner of uh communities in georgia this was highlighted for me as uh you indicated when i was able to travel to um to vista to announce a 8.8.5 million dollar grant to support a wastewater treatment plant and i see some of those folks on this other call today and appreciate their continued partnership we're also excited to look forward to the future sir uh there's two billion dollars of of resources for broadband in the recently passed uh infrastructure bill and a much larger potential infusion of capital across rural development and usda in the buildback better initiative that we hope we see some progress on soon that initiative represents again key investment in clean water and housing and clean energy and other types of economic development that rural communities in georgia hopefully will see some of i'm really pleased that some of our key team members can be here tonight to share more about our programs i'd be remiss if i didn't call out reggie taylor who's our uh the rd state director he in georgia who brings just extremely significant experience in the state and with all of our programs he and his team are just top-notch and will be extremely useful to all of you thank you again for this invitation we're excited to be here and uh i look forward to our time together sir i think you're on mute there you go thank you deputy under secretary maxon i'd like to introduce now miss stephanie beshrucky stephanie is a veteran of congress having worked as a senior policy advisor and legislative director to my rural community colleagues congresswoman sherry bustos and former congresswoman abby fickenhauer stephanie is the chief of staff of the rural business cooperative service and will be telling us about several programs including value-added producer grants and the rural micro entrepreneur assistance program which are part of the service's mission to help businesses grow and provide job training for people living in rural areas stephanie thank you for joining us thank you so much and because our time is limited i'll go ahead and jump right in so rural development is comprised of three agencies you've got a representative from each of them here on the line today so at rural business cooperative service where i work we are we're unique we are focused on job creation and economic opportunity in rural communities we have more than 15 programs that allow us to touch all the different sectors and industries that are important to rural communities across the country so if you're a hardware store you're a farmer-owned business or even a larger employer like a manufacturing plant we may have something that might be able to help you i think that's something a lot of folks don't realize about our programs at world business cooperative services most of them are administered to rules fault businesses through third parties um our partners on the ground who make loans grants and provide technical assistance through resources that are provided to them by real business cooperative service and the rural micro entrepreneur assistance program which is among our business programs is an excellent example of that and i'm very excited that we're joined here by mr cook from the southwest georgia united empowerment zone who's going to be able to talk a little bit more about their experience serving as one of the micro entrepreneur development organizations under the program so as i mentioned this is a program that's largely administered through third parties specifically non-profits tribes and institutions of higher education to serve micro entrepreneurs so probably you're thinking who is a micro entrepreneur what does that mean so these are our smallest of small businesses these are the entrepreneurs who are just getting started and for the purpose of this program these small businesses they need to have less than 10 employees and they need to be located in a rural area so as i talked about organizations like southwest georgia united empowerment zone really administered the program so what is the role of usda usda provides loans to organizations like this one here in georgia to then set up revolving loan funds and re-lend them to these small businesses the businesses pay back the third party who then in turn pays usda back over in time usda also provides grants to these organizations to provide hands-on technical assistance think management coaching business planning services or marketing assistance so the role of usda from the perspective of the business owner it seems very minimal because they are working with somebody in their community who knows their business and knows their area and i'm really excited that we were able to talk about this program because i do think that this is something that is so important when we think about recovery from coven 19 and how we're going to help some of these rural communities get back on their feet and thinking about some of the um reactions we saw after the recession was people want to start their own businesses and programs like this are here to help um go ahead and hit the next slide for me i also want to touch on our value-added producer grant program now i understand there was some interest in the healthy food financing initiative as well we won't have time to cover that today but i have included some information on the slide deck which i provided to the congressman staff for reference after the fact for folks who want to learn more so for the value-added producer grants i get the next slide thank you this is a really exciting program because of the stories that come out of it this helps producers get into new markets and this is a top priority for secretary vilsack and really gets it addressing competition in agriculture and thinking about some of those disruptions that we saw on the food supply chain and how we're going to strengthen it this program can be a really important tool so the first thing is you know value added producer value-added activities what does that mean and i think the easiest way to try to explain what that means is to give examples so this is your peanut farmer who wants to start making peanut butter on his farm and sell it locally at the farmers market or to local grocery stores it's farmer with free-range chickens now he can market that they're free range and he can charge more for those eggs that's value-added or and it doesn't have to be food too think about the dairy farmer who wants to put put an anaerobic digester on his property and do turn manure into electricity these are all examples of the types of projects that the value-added producer grant program can support so these are grants for planning this can include paying somebody to a feasibility study for you and working capital that can cover costs like packaging and labeling maybe you want to do an advertisement campaign or cover the salaries for your employees these are the kind of costs that agriculture producers experience when they're trying to diversify their operation and get into these new kinds of activities now with that i do want to clarify and say that this program is only open to agricultural producers and producer-owned businesses and this can include cooperatives as well so role of usda in this program this is one of the programs that applicants will apply directly to usda usda reviews these applications and makes the award we do have priority in the program for new and beginning farmers socially disadvantaged farmers and projects that support local foods so if you're interested in getting started you want to learn more i strongly recommend that you talk to my colleagues in this georgia state office about this program and similarly to the rural micro entrepreneur assistance program they can also help point you in the right direction of some of our partners in your area who can assist can i get the next slide so i've included links to all of these programs for folks who want to go back and learn more through our website also through rd.usda.gov you can learn about all of our different programs last line and to close i've included my contact information here as well as that of our administrator dr karama neal who sends her regrets that she couldn't be here tonight but please don't hesitate to reach out we're here ready to help and i know that reggie is as well known as his team who i'm sure many of you have already gotten the chance to know with that i'll go ahead and include include my remarks and turn it back to you german i think that you may be on youtube next up is karen compton karen is a long-time public servant having worked both in the office of management and budget in the obama administration as well as the senior staff on capitol hill including top rolls with senators from vermont and west virginia states with strong rural communities she's the chief of staff for the rural utility service and will be presenting some of its programs tonight including special evaluation assistance for rural communities and households known as search grants as well as the circuit rider program and the water and waste disposal loan and grant program these programs provide much needed infrastructure and infrastructure improvements to our rural communities such as water and waste treatment electric power and telecommunications services karen thank you for joining us tonight thank you congressman um it's a pleasure to be with you all um my colleague steph mentioned the rural uh if in one word we do infrastructure um albeit whether it's broadband and telecom or um water and wastewater which is what we'll talk about this evening or our electrical and smart grid program so next slide this is just a snapshot of what we do at wep we finance water and wastewater utilities um through both direct loans and grants uh as well as um loan guarantees so we are a real pro program and so our population threshold for most of our programs is 10 000 or less our loan guarantee um is uh for populations of 50 000 or less um something we're really proud of just in fy 21. we invested 2.2 billion dollars in rural communities that had an impact of 6.4 million rural residents um we can finance um either the improvement of a current facility the construction of a new facility or the acquisition of a facility that's needed to expand or maintain water treatment clean drinking water solid waste or storm water collection unlike many of the programs at rural development that are operated through our headquarters in washington washington dc web is administered through for our 47 rural development state offices and all of the field offices across rural america next slide our flagship program the water and waste disposal learning program program um this is you know our bread and butter what we do every day um we provide low low interest direct loan and grant funding for drinking water and wastewater sanitary sewage disposal and stormwater drainage to both households and businesses the funding can be used for sourcing treatment storage sewer collection disposal and uh transmission and and disposal um next slide the term of these uh loans can extend up to 40 years based on the life cycle of the project um or state statute the interest rates are fixed and um based on the on the median household income error of the area to be served next slide in addition to loans and grants um like i said we did have we do have the water and waste disposal loan guarantees um what this does is we help private lenders connect with qualified buyer borrowers to um come up with the same sorts of funding mechanisms that uh for for water and wastewater disposal systems uh in rural area as i mentioned the population for the loan guarantee uh the threshold is slightly larger at 50 000 and the eligible entities uh for the program and and the um the previous program are your state and local municipalities nonprofits um federally recognized tribes um and uh colonias um they have the same purposes as our direct loan um programs so just drinking water um you know sewer collection uh wastewater management um the the terms uh with the loan guarantee are um the lender along with the agency will establish um the the terms and it also has can have up to a 40-year or states uh or or limit on on the state statute for the the term of the loan um the interest rates are negotiated between the the lender and the borrower um yeah next slide as the congressman mentioned uh one of the programs that we're i'm very proud of are is our special evaluation assistance for rural communities and households and are which is a mouthful so uh our search grants um and what's unique about this program is that it helps the very small the smallest of communities that are in financial distress um and it it helps them really the beginning of the of of the the concept of what they want to do with water infrastructure um so as you can see the eligible area are for communities of 2500 or less so we really are targeting um the smallest um and again the eligible entities that can apply are state and local entities uh nonprofits uh federally recognized tribes um and as i mentioned um unlike some of the our other programs these can pay that this uh this grant can pay for pre-development planning um and that's whether it's uh you know a feasibility study preliminary engineering design it can also help pay for the technical assistance that a community may need when they eventually apply for for a loan the last program um that i'll talk about is our circuit rider program um and this is a really unique uh program it's a partnership um with our us and the national rural water association and we contract with them and they have um contractors out throughout the entire country and and all of the territories and they provide your boots on the ground uh technical assistance um what does that look like um you know in the aftermath of a natural disaster um they're often the first uh folks on the scene um that are ready to get um the systems back up and running um they also provide um training to local um local folks in local systems they also they they they work on technical assistance as well one thing of note you don't have to be a borrower to access the services of the circuit rider program so um and then i know in the uh in georgia uh your georgia rural water association um they have their own website um and offer conferences and training and conservation so um that's it for me just to wrap it up in the interest of time and i'll put my name and contact information in the chat thank you so much thank you very much uh karen uh let me just uh remind you that if you have any questions and i hope that you will uh please type your questions into the question and answer box at the bottom of your screen we want to be able to accommodate your questions so please put them in at the bottom of the screen at this time our final presenter from usda this evening is jamal habibi jamal has served as an outreach director during the obama administration was previously a special assistant with usda he once again joined usda after having most recently served as a senior associate with the opportunity finance network a network of community development financial institutions cdfis he is the chief of staff for a rural housing service which offers a variety of programs to build or improve housing and essential community facilities in rural areas tonight he will be introducing us to the community facilities program jamal thank you for joining us and the floor is yours fantastic thanks for having me congressman as the congressman mentioned i'm jamal habibi chief of staff for the rural housing service at usda at the rural housing service we provide loans and grants for single-family housing multi-family housing aka rental housing and community facilities which is the congressman mentioned i'll focus in on today i just wanted to highlight that this year we've been working hard to support those in rural america and helping them stay in their homes and working where we can to extend loan deferrals and forbearance to borrowers this year for our multi-family portfolio we've got about 400 000 tenants and we were actually able to help about 27 000 individuals stay current on their rent and avoid eviction we've also been working closely with homeowners who have been financially impacted by covid19 and working with them and lenders and servicers to to help with repayment options affordable repayment options for their mortgages and while our single family and multi-family programs have done a lot to protect homeowners and tenants our community facilities portfolio does a lot of work as well especially in the congressman's district i was looking at the numbers earlier today and we've done close to 200 projects in the congressman's district in the last 20 years so we're really grateful for that as this slide indicates uh uh if you go back one uh to provide more background on our community facilities program or cf program uh the program offers direct loans loan guarantees and grants to develop or improve essential public services and facilities this can include fire houses community centers child care centers health care facilities rural hospitals and more eligible applicants to apply may include public public bodies or localities non-profits native tribes and funds can be used to construct expand or renovate and improve facilities typically our direct program serves populations of about 20 000 or less just last year our community facilities investments reached about 1.8 billion dollars with 1.1 billion of that going to health care facilities and about 400 million going to educational facilities next slide and as just stated right there this kind of highlights a breakdown of the eligible rural areas communities of less than 20 000 and eligible entities as well including public bodies uh non-profits and tribes next slide please and then again as discussed here's kind of the breakdown of uh of different industries uh that we we finance and serve in the congressman's district i know that we've worked closely uh particularly on the public safety side and public building side um in terms of financing and grants but this is just kind of a general breakdown of what our portfolio serves next slide please and education as well you know as mentioned we fund uh we help provide financing to schools to child care centers here's kind of a breakdown we've done uh sick over 1600 projects totaling 3.6 billion for education facilities we've done over 290 million for college dormitories and we've done about 300 million for education administration facilities as well and then highlighted below of course is that 400 million dollar number that we did specifically for education in fiscal year 2021. moving on to the next slide right here we've highlighted our rates for our direct loan program interest rates currently at 2.125 percent which is quite favorable uh 40-year term adequate security and collateral needed and ability to repay as well and must be able to demonstrate that the applicant is unable to obtain other commercial credit next slide please and then these are our guaranteed terms um you know just to highlight we've got a direct program and a guaranteed program which have different terms and of course our guaranteed program works through our guaranteed lenders the interest rate is set by the lender and uh of course requires repayment ability and adequate security as well um lender must be unable to make loan without guarantees and um up to an 80 guarantee on the loss and of course there's an upfront fee of 1.25 percent be payable upon issuance of of low note guarantees and then finally uh we wanted to uh you know thank uh the congressman for his advocacy for our emergency rural health care grant program uh which congress provided 500 million dollars in the american rescue plan act the program provides up to 500 million in grant funding to broaden access to covet 19 testing and vaccinations rural health care services and help cover backdoo cova 19 expenses as well we divided the program into two different tracks track one our recovery grant which provides immediate relief to address the economic conditions arising from covid19 whereas our track 2 grants we call them our impact grants advance ideas and solutions to solve regional rural health care problems so our ideas behind this and we worked really closely with members of congress in both the majority and minority to address the short-term and immediate impacts but also with track 2 how can we work to build strong operational infrastructure in rural healthcare facilities for the long term to address future health crisis and i can say that we've received over 600 applications thus far the application deadline for that has closed and finally i'd like to provide some contact information chad parker is our administrator our deputy administrator for community facilities his email is below you can also go to rd.usda.gov as well for more information on the programs and with that i think we are right on uh schedule back to the congressman thank you thank you very much i want to thank deputy under secretary maxon and all of the chiefs of staff for these important rural development service areas we learned about a lot of great programs that can help our agricultural producers our businesses and local governments and i hope that those attending tonight's town hall have learned about one or more programs to which you uh can apply now i completely understand that for some the application progress process may be intimidating but success is possible uh rather than having you take my word for it i have invited a couple of these success stories to join us this evening and share their experiences first up is mayor kevin brown of buena vista georgia in marion county mayor brown served his country and is a proud veteran of the army following his active duty service he served as a veterans representative and job specialist with the georgia department of labor which was followed by an 18-year career as a director for marion county family connections he's a lifelong resident of buena vista a former city councilman for the city of buena vista and a former county commissioner for marion county georgia i was pleased to join mayor brown and deputy under secretary maxon in announcing this monumental investment in buena vista unfortunately due to urgent city business mayor brown was unable to join us in person this evening but he did provide a video to share about buena vista's successful application for a water and waste disposal loan and grant award from usda rural development good evening i'm kevin brown mayor for the city of manifesto georgia i am so thankful for the opportunity to be with you this evening and bless that we can share a great experience first just a little bit about our beautiful town of benavista we are a very rural community but we have a lot to offer those who visit us benavista is the birthplace of the legendary negro league baseball player josh gibson if you would like to visit benavista you can find us approximately 30 miles southeast of fort benning and columbus georgia although we have a beautiful city we have challenges just as other cities most recently we were faced with a permitting challenge from the environmental protection division as it relates to our current wastewater treatment facility our current facility could not meet the requirements of the new permit therefore the city would have to construct a new wastewater facility the construction cost would be over around 8 million this amount for a city of our size created a substantial challenge in order to repay a loan of this size we're required that our current water rates be increased from approximately 24 per month to 85 dollars per month per water customer many of our customers were and are facing challenges from covet and lack of jobs this hardship could further plunge them into even more financial burden and hardship thankfully i as a newly elected mayor have a congressman who looks out for his constituents i was able to simply pick up the phone reach out to his district field aide and the rest is history congressman bishop connected me with the proper agency representatives who are ready to assist the federal and state level of usda rural development their agency heads dispatch staff to assist us long story short we received 75 grant assistance so we were left with a loan that was manageable to construct our new wastewater facility so i'm very thankful that i have a congressman who looks out for us and i'm thankful that we can communicate what agency has at our state and federal level to provide assistance to a real community as well so today yes i'm very thankful thank you our next success story comes to us from southwest georgia united joining us this evening is executive director robert cook southwest georgia united is a community development financial institution cdfi and community development corporation which is based in crisp county mr cook has more than 35 years of experience in community development finance housing economic development and human services has written successful applications for more than 20 million dollars in grant funds among those successes is a rural micro entrepreneur assistance program award mr cook thank you for joining us tonight and sharing with us your experience applying for and working with usda through this program mr cook thank you congressman we were created southwest georgia united was originally created to administer a usda federal rural empowerment zone so we've been a co a customer and very grateful to usda ever since we began in 1995. our micro loans are usually well they're less than 50 000 that's the way they're defined and small loans like that are typically not profitable because the staff needed to administer the loan provide the development services that the borrowers need um exceeds the value that you can get from the the interest um and as a cdfi we do our best to support ourselves and support our communities by loaning money and to community needs and being repaid the um the rmap program because of the associated grant makes it possible for uh for us to maintain enough staff members to actually provide the services needed by our entrepreneurs for these very small loans well we can keep our interest rate low we're significantly less than the rates on credit cards or quick loan stores which frequently are the only opportunities um for for our borrowers they one of the reasons that they come to us is that for one reason or another they cannot go to a bank we'… ,no longer

However, White farmers who also got relief were lead to be they were forgotten about by Stephen Miller from the Trump campaign  and sued.

There are limited cost-effective options to control herbicide-resistant weeds affecting these commodities, but more dicamba-tolerant acreage of soybean and cotton crops are being planted each year. EPA used research and input from state regulators, grower groups, academic researchers, pesticide manufacturers and others to inform the decision to expand registrations, and this action balances environmental concerns while giving farmers more certainty as they plan their crops for the upcoming year.
 
In September, I joined several of my colleagues in sending a letter to Administrator Wheeler requesting this move to support our farmers, especially as they continue to recover from market disruptions from COVID-19. I am very glad to see this action from EPA, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have for our farmers and in setting responsible environmental policy that doesn’t stifle economic growth.

This report comes after USTR hosted virtual hearings in August with fruit and vegetable growers from Georgia and Florida. These hearings were the result of years of bipartisan work by members of the Georgia and Florida Congressional Delegations, and I thank President Trump, Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Perdue, and Secretary Ross for their ongoing commitment to addressing our concerns and creating a more level playing field for American producers.

For too long, countries like Mexico have taken advantage of loopholes in our trade agreements and flooded our domestic markets with cheap government-subsidized produce at prices below the cost of production, causing serious financial injury to American growers. While I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this report and working with the Administration to implement these new steps, there is also a burden on American retailers. America’s grocery retailers are posting record profits while American farm revenues are at record lows. Retailers have the responsibility to stop stocking products from countries that engage in unfair trade practices against the American farm family. I also encourage Americans to purchase American-grown farm products whenever possible to support our growers, especially in these unprecedented times.

Governor Kemp’s Executive Order 04.20.20.01

Which new entities can engage in Minimum Basic Operations?
Gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, cosmetologists, hair designers, nail care artists, estheticians, their respective schools, and massage therapists can begin engaging in Minimum Basic Operations on Friday, April 24, 2020. This means these businesses can open to the public on a limited basis, subject to restrictions.
The current shelter-in-place order will expire at 11:59 P.M. on April 30, 2020. After that date, new rules will be promulgated by the Governor through Executive Order to continue to limit social interaction while providing flexibility for business owners to maintain the value of their business.
Restaurants and dining rooms of private social clubs will be allowed to reopen on a limited basis on Monday, April 27, 2020, subject to new restrictions to be promulgated by the Governor on Thursday, April 23, 2020.
Theaters will also be permitted to engage in Minimum Basic Operations beginning Monday, April 27, 2020, subject to new restrictions to be promulgated by the Governor on Thursday, April 23, 2020.
Bars, nightclubs, amusement park ride operators, and live performance venues will remain closed through at least May 13, 2020 when the Public Health State of Emergency is set to expire.
What are Minimum Basic Operations?
Minimum Basic Operations include the following categories:
• The minimum necessary activities to maintain the value of a business, establishment, corporation, non-profit corporation, or organization; provide services; manage inventory; ensure security; process payroll and employee benefits; or for related functions, and such minimum necessary activities include remaining open to the public subject to the restrictions of this Order
• The minimum necessary activities to facilitate employees or volunteers being able to work remotely from their residences or members or patrons being able to participate remotely from their residences
• Instances where employees are working outdoors without regular contact with other persons, such as delivery services, contractors, landscape businesses, and agricultural industry services

All businesses, establishments, corporations, non-profit corporations, and organizations that are subject to the Minimum Basic Operations restrictions shall implement measures which mitigate the exposure and spread of COVID-19. Such measures shall include:
1. Screening and evaluating workers who exhibit signs of illness, such as a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, cough, or shortness of breath;
2. Requiring workers who exhibit signs of illness to not report to work or to seek medical attention;
3. Enhancing sanitation of the workplace as appropriate;
4. Requiring hand washing or sanitation by workers at appropriate places within
the business location;
5. Providing personal protective equipment as available and appropriate to the
function and location of the worker within the business location;
6. Prohibiting gatherings of workers during working hours;
7. Permitting workers to take breaks and meals outside, in their office or personal
workspace, or in such other areas where proper social distancing is attainable;
8. Implementing teleworking for all possible workers;
9. Implementing staggered shifts for all possible workers;
10. Holding all meetings and conferences virtually, wherever possible;
11. Delivering intangible services remotely wherever possible;
12. Discouraging workers from using other workers’ phones, desks, offices, or
other work tools and equipment;
13. Prohibiting handshaking and other unnecessary person-to-person contact in
the workplace;
14. Placing notices that encourage hand hygiene at the entrance to the workplace
and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen;
15. Suspending the use of Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) pads, PIN entry devices, electronic signature capture, and any other credit card receipt signature requirements to the extent such suspension is permitted by
agreements with credit card companies and credit agencies;
16. Enforcing social distancing of non-cohabitating persons while present on such
entity’s leased or owned property;
17. For retailers and service providers, providing for alternative points of sale
outside of buildings, including curbside pickup or delivery of products and/or
services if an alternative point of sale is permitted under Georgia law;
18. Increasing physical space between workers and customers;
19. Providing disinfectant and sanitation products for workers to clean their
workspace, equipment, and tools;
20. Increasing physical space between workers’ worksites to at least six (6) feet.

Can healthcare facilities conduct elective surgeries?
Many healthcare facilities across Georgia voluntarily ceased elective surgeries to reduce equipment and personnel shortages. Given recent changes in modeling related to surge capacity and national supply, Georgia healthcare facilities are better positioned to secure the necessary personal protective equipment to resume elective surgeries.

How does this Executive Order apply to places of worship?
Holding in-person services at places of worship is allowed, but services must be held in accordance with strict social distancing protocols. At the beginning of the pandemic, places of worship were asked to move to online or drive-in services to help Georgia flatten the curve for coronavirus.
The Governor is appreciative of faith leaders taking these measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Although online or drive-in services remain the best way to prevent the spread of the virus, now that we have greater capacity in our healthcare system, the Governor wants to provide places of worship the flexibility to return to in-person services.
Nothing prevents a place of worship from hosting an in-person service, and the state will not stand in the way of these efforts. However, places of worship should maintain strict social distancing if they choose to return to in-person services. Parishioners should maintain at least six feet of distance from those persons that do not cohabitate with them.

All organizations are required to limit gatherings to a size where social distancing may be enforced among all persons. This means in looking at the entire square footage of a gathering space, a place of worship should ensure there is enough room for all persons to have at least six feet between themselves and anyone else if needed.
Best Practices for Religious Services
This list does not cover every scenario. Places of worship and religious institutions need to tailor their guidance to reflect their specific needs and resources.
• Online, call-in, or drive-in services remain the best options to mitigate potential exposure to coronavirus.
• Do not attend religious services if you are not feeling well, have a fever, or have had direct contact with someone who likely has or is confirmed to have COVID-19.
• Throughout the service, maintain at least six feet between the person in front of you, behind you, and each side of you.
• Family members and cohabitating individuals are allowed to sit together.
• Please wear a face mask or cloth covering to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.

• Depending on the size of the congregation, additional services may be necessary to achieve at least six feet between non-cohabitating members.
• When members arrive, they should immediately be seated, and once a service ends, rows should be emptied sequentially with everyone immediately going to their vehicles.
• Refrain from using items touched by multiple people unless you can sanitize after each use. For example, in lieu of offering plates, consider using a dropbox.
• If you closed nurseries, childcare, Sunday School classes, or related functions, strongly consider keeping them closed for the foreseeable future.
• Medically fragile and elderly Georgians should continue to shelter in place and utilize remote services instead of in-person services.
• Strongly consider cancelling choir and choir practice to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Is the Governor’s Shelter in Place Order still in effect?
The Shelter in Place Order is still active and expires at 11:59 PM on April 30, 2020 for most Georgians. Medically fragile and elderly Georgians should plan to continue sheltering in place through at least May 13, 2020. The Governor’s Office urges everyone to continue to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Georgia Department of Public Health guidance to prevent the spread of COVID-19.", ,no longer populated,,2020-04-23T13:31:44.000Z,post data removed,,10,6,1,0,,

""PORK"" In Agriculture

Members of Congress have long used the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to feed at the trough.  The number of earmarks increased by 7.7 percent, from 13 in FY 2018 to 14 in FY 2019, and the cost increased by 37.7 percent, from $108 million in FY 2018 to $148.7 million in FY 2019.

$10,000,000 for high energy cost grants within the Rural Utilities Service (RUS).  The RUS grew out of the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Electrification Administration (REA) of the 1930s.  The REA’s mission was to promote electrification to farmers and residents in communities where the cost of providing electricity was considered to be too expensive for local utilities.  By 1981, 98.7 percent electrification and 95 percent telephone service coverage was achieved.  Rather than declaring victory and shutting down the REA, the agency was transformed into the RUS, and expanded into other areas.

RUS high energy cost grants are intended to assist communities whose energy costs exceed 275 percent of the national average by funding the construction, installation, and repair of energy distribution facilities.  This may sound like a bright idea, but the RUS Electric Loan Program is intended to achieve the same objective.  Former President Obama’s FY 2013 version of Cuts, Consolidations, and Savings proposed the elimination of the High Energy Cost Program, noting that low-interest electric loans are available through the RUS to residents of the areas served by the High Energy Cost Program, which include Alaska, Hawaii, several communities in certain other states, and U.S. territories.   

Since FY 2002, members of Congress have added nine earmarks for high energy cost grants totaling $143.5 million.

$9,000,000 for a fruit fly quarantine program.  After a 10-year furlough, members of Congress have returned to the trenches in the war against fruit flies.  The $9 million earmarked in FY 2019 represents an 1,819 percent increase from the $469,000 in FY 2009, the last earmark provided for fruit fly research, eradication, or quarantine.  It is also the third-largest earmark ever for this purpose.

Since FY 1991, members of Congress have added 12 earmarks costing $39.2 million for fruit fly research, eradication, or quarantine.  Past legislators who added earmarks include then-Rep. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), and the late Sens. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii) and Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii).

$8,000,000 for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the Delta Regional Authority (DRA), a 33.3 percent increase from the $6 million earmarked in FY 2018.  The DRA also received an earmark costing $22.5 million in the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

Both the ARC and DRA have been targeted by numerous cost-cutting plans.  President Trump’s FY 2018 Major Savings and Reforms recommended eliminating the ARC, the DRA, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission, saving $156 million.  Each of the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) budgets from FYs 2017 through 2020 called for the termination of regional commissions.  Former President Obama’s FY 2017 version of Cuts, Consolidations, and Savings proposed a $3 million annual cut for the DRA. 

The ARC was created by Congress in 1965 to “bring the 13 Appalachian states into the mainstream of the American economy,” and covers all of West Virginia along with portions of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.  The ARC duplicates dozens of federal, state, and local programs.

Established in 2000, the DRA is intended to provide economic development assistance to support the creation of jobs and improve local conditions for the 10 million people who reside in 252 counties and parishes throughout the Mississippi Delta states of Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. 

The ARC has received 12 earmarks costing $395.8 million since FY 1995, and the DRA has received 14 earmarks costing $104.9 million since FY 2003.", ,no longer populated,,2019-12-15T19:09:53.000Z,post data removed,,,,0,0,,

Vital voice

On May 24, Republicans in the 8th Congressional District will have the opportunity to choose a candidate to represent the party in the November General Election. Given the political affiliation of those voting in the 8th District, the Republican candidate will likely be the winner in November and go on to represent our district in the next Congress. Two of the primary areas of interest within our district remain agriculture and defense. Although not well-versed on agriculture, I do understand the defense issues that impact our district. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, so does Austin Scott.

For the past nearly six years, U.S. Rep. Scott remains a vocal critic of any effort to close military bases without the Defense Department first fully justifying the need. He fought hard to protect the Air Force Reserve Command when political forces tried to gut the headquarters at Robins Air Force Base

Bottom line: as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Austin Scott has a proven track record of fighting for those defense issues most important to those of us in the 8th District. This, at a time when his role on the House Armed Services Committee is even more vital because Georgia currently does not have a voice on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Given the challenges facing our national defense, our military, and our local installations, I strongly encourage you to vote for Austin Scott in the upcoming Republican primary.

By:  Sen. Bill Cowsert (R – Athens)
       Georgia Senate Majority Leader

Under the Gold Dome in Atlanta, we’ve just passed the half-way point in this year’s legislative session. While meeting with constituents, I’m often asked exactly what we do on a day-to-day basis.

Most people know that after a bill is introduced, it is referred to a committee, where public hearings are held to solicit input from citizens and other interested parties affected by the proposed law. Bills are discussed and often amended or changed in the committee process. Eventually the bills are either defeated or passed out of committee and sent to the Senate floor for a full vote. So far, only 23 bills out of 181 introduced have been passed on the Senate floor. The remaining bills are under consideration in various committees.

There are 27 Senate committees ranging from Agriculture to Judiciary, from Education to Retirement. The committee process utilizes the input of our many Senators’ varied backgrounds – and we have a wide variety of backgrounds in the Georgia State Senate. This is the advantage of Georgia’s citizen legislature. We are part-time public servants who hold real jobs in the real world. This gives each of us tangible experience that we can bring to the Capitol to help us enact sound policy.

It is in the committees where the personal, professional, and educational expertise of the various committee members is best utilized to fine tune bills into what will become effective laws. Many people feel that the Georgia Capitol is filled with lawyers – and nine of the 10 members of the Judiciary Committee, for example, are lawyers. But when you look at the Senate as a whole, only 10 of 56 Senators are lawyers. About half of the Senators are business executives with expertise in construction, insurance, the automotive industry, etc. We have six farmers, two of whom – Sen. Bill Heath and Sen. Frank Ginn – are also engineers. We have two physicians and a dentist; two car dealership owners, several home builders, and an underground utilities contractor. A great example of our varied backgrounds is freshman Sen. Greg Kirk, who holds a master’s degree in psychology, is a real estate businessman, and an ordained minister.

These are some other great examples of experience and expertise at work in the Capitol:

• The Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Committee is chaired by Sen. John Wilkinson, a retired teacher and farmer who formerly chaired the Georgia Department of Education’s agriculture education programs. Three other farmers serve on that committee.
• The Appropriations Committee Chairman, Sen. Jack Hill, is a retired grocer who can do more math in his head than some people can do with a calculator. He knows more about the state budget than anyone in Georgia, after serving in the legislature for 26 years.
• The chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, Sen. Renee Unterman, is a nurse and clinically trained social worker. 
• A doctor, Sen. Ben Watson, and a volunteer firefighter, Sen. John Albers, both serve on the Public Safety Committee, which is chaired by the youngest state senator, 28-year-old Tyler Harper.
• The chairman of the Education Committee, Sen. Lindsey Tippins, served 12 years on the Cobb County Board of Education, always returning his full salary for student scholarships or teacher stipends.
• The chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Sen. Hunter Hill, is a West Point graduate who commanded combat teams in Iraq and Afghanistan and has been awarded two Bronze Stars, the Meritorious Service Medal, and two Army Commendation Medals. The vice chair, Sen. Ed Harbison, served three tours in Vietnam with the Marine Corps and was awarded a Purple Heart. The Secretary of the committee, Sen. Mike Dugan, is a retired Lieutenant Colonel who served as an Army Ranger and Master Paratrooper.

These are the experts I am proud to work with every day as we strive to pass laws benefiting the citizens of Georgia.", ,no longer populated,,2015-02-26T20:12:05.000Z,post data removed,,3,3,1,0,,
