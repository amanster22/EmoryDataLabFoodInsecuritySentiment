Slavery was legal. Jim Crow was legal. The US Government paying reparations to white enslavers and not to the enslaved was legal. Prison slavery is still legal. The lesson is‚Äîdo not let legality and power be a measure of morality and justice. And this is the lesson to remember now as the new MAGA government dismantles every semblance of a functioning society under the guise of ‚Äúlaw and order.‚Äù Their acts are not only likely illegal, they are absolutely immoral and unjust. And unless we act with immediate urgency the damage done will be irreparable. What are these injustices, and how do we work with meaningful action to counter them? Let‚Äôs Address This.

In just a few weeks, the Trump administration has unleashed some of the most sweeping assaults on democracy, civil rights, and global stability in modern history. Every move has been calculated to entrench authoritarian control, whether by punishing law enforcement officials who prosecuted insurrectionists, dismantling public health protections, handing over government power to billionaires, criminalizing diversity and thought, or upending global trade agreements. These are not the actions of a democratic leader‚Äîthey are the hallmarks of a fascist regime.

Here are seven of the most dangerous actions Trump has taken so far‚Äîand likewise‚Äîwhat actions can take to counter and protect from the harm he is causing.

1. Handing an Unelected Billionaire Control Over Americans‚Äô Financial Data
Trump‚Äôs Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessant, has granted Elon Musk full access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems. Musk‚Äôs cronies have reportedly blocked out government officials from their own systems. This means Musk, a private billionaire with no official government position, now has direct access to:

Federal grant and loan distributions

Social Security and Medicare benefits records

Government contractor payments, including those that compete directly with Musk‚Äôs companies

This is blatant corruption. Musk previously publicly pressured Trump to fire the FAA administrator after the agency fined SpaceX for safety violations. The administrator was fired on January 20th. And we‚Äôve already seen the devastation caused in air traffic. Two days later, Trump‚Äôs Treasury Department handed Musk access to the most sensitive financial data in the country.

A reminder once more that the President has zero authority to reallocate funds already appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose. And an unelected billionaire oligarch has even less than zero authority to hijack and reallocate funds.

If Musk were an elected official, this would be a massive conflict of interest. Instead, it‚Äôs something even worse: a billionaire oligarch being given unchecked power over Americans‚Äô financial information. If any other nation on Earth did this we‚Äôd consider it a coup. And that‚Äôs what this is. This is a coup. A hostile takeover. A Constitutional crisis. Meanwhile, a reminder that 16 Democrats joined Republicans to confirm the billionaire hedge fund manager Bessant, who is now handing over the keys to our $28T economy to Musk.

2. Weaponizing the Justice System: Firing FBI Officials Who Investigated the Insurrection
This attempted purge of FBI officials involved in the prosecution of January 6th insurrectionists is of the most chilling early actions of the Trump regime. A reminder that Trump pardoned 1,500 white supremacist felons convicted for their role in the violent coup attempt. The people who stormed the Capitol in tactical gear, wore ‚ÄúCamp Auschwitz shirts,‚Äù beat police officers to death, and openly called to execute public officials are now free to walk the streets, while the law enforcement officials who held them accountable are being punished for doing their jobs.

Now, the Department of Justice has ordered the termination of eight senior FBI officials and demanded a list of every agent who worked on prosecuting January 6 insurrectionists. This is a direct authoritarian attack on law enforcement officials who dared to uphold the rule of law. In response, several of my contacts in the FBI leaked the following internal updates to me:

When told they were being fired, the FBI executives refused to leave. The Agents Association advised the Administration that it was unlawful by statute. They told the Administration they are required full formal OPR [Office of Professional Responsibility] adjudication before dismissals as we are not political appointees. So the Administration threatened that ‚Äúwe will OPR you‚Äù and all executives said ‚Äúgo for it.‚Äù Bottom line no one was walked out. The Administration backed down once they were threatened with legal action. They may OPR everyone but good luck with that. This makes me feel much better. Keeping you up to date.
One of the first rules in resisting autocracy is ‚Äúdo not comply in advance.‚Äù Therefore, it is encouraging to see that the targeted FBI officials have threatened legal action, which has temporarily halted the firings. The FBI has also refused to turn over the names of agents involved in January 6th cases until the DOJ provides a legal justification. As a reminder, this is the same tactic Trump used last week when he attempted to purge 17 Inspectors General. The IGs also responded by pointing out that Trump did not follow the legal procedure to fire them, and therefore refused to leave their posts. Finally, USDA Inspector General Phyllis Fong was forced to leave. This is courage in the face of fascism.

Clearly, Trump does not support law enforcement. He only supports law enforcement when it is a tool to uphold white supremacy and silence dissent.

3. Censoring Public Health: Erasing Critical Medical Information
The Trump regime has purged crucial public health resources from government websites, an action that medical experts warn will cost lives. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has removed:

Contraception guidance

HIV prevention and treatment resources

Studies on mental health in transgender and nonbinary communities

Data on bullying, suicide rates, and drug use in marginalized communities

The Infectious Diseases Society of America has condemned these removals, stating that erasing HIV information directly undermines efforts to end the epidemic, and will lead to more death. Indeed, as we still recover from the deadly COVID pandemic, we know all too well how stripping access to health resources costs lives. This move by the Trump regime will kill people, and sadly that appears to be the point.

4. Reviving Concentration Camps: 30,000 Migrants to Be Detained at Guantanamo Bay
Trump‚Äôs Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is preparing to detain up to 30,000 migrants at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

This is not just a return to some of the darkest moments of U.S. history‚Äîit is an intentional echo of Executive Order 9066, which led to the mass internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Already we see reports of ICE illegally detaining U.S. citizens, assuming they are ‚Äúillegal‚Äù because of the color of their skin. Meanwhile DHS Secretary Noem, whom 6 Democrats joined Republicans to confirm, is on the streets with ICE assisting, even as IC raids of schools and hospitals. Yes, even children are not spared this cruelty, including sick children. For example, the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Atlanta sent a notice to its entire staff to prepare for ICE raids, and provided guidance on how to remain calm when they show up. The Trump regime wants Americans to believe that ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is targeting and arresting sick children at their most vulnerable point in life. Barbaric.

And for those who claim that ‚ÄúAmerica is becoming 1930s Germany‚Äù, let‚Äôs remember that in the 1930s, Hitler sent his lawyers to study U.S. segregation laws, ultimately to model his own genocidal policies. America was Hitler‚Äôs blueprint, and shockingly, Hitler‚Äôs lawyers reported back to him that the U.S. segregation laws were in fact ‚Äútoo extreme, even for Nazis.‚Äù (The pre-eminent book on this topic is Hitler‚Äôs American Model by Princeton Professor James Q Whitman). Trump is not ‚Äúcopying 1930s Germany,‚Äù but reviving 1920s America‚Äîthe America of Jim Crow, immigration bans, women‚Äôs oppression, and state-sanctioned racial violence.

That is what ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù has always meant.

5. Shutting Down Humanitarian Aid: USAID Purge
The Trump regime has virtually dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)‚Äîthe agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to people in crisis worldwide.

At least 56 senior USAID officials have been placed on administrative leave, while over $1 billion in critical aid has been frozen. This means:

Food assistance for starving children has been blocked

Medical aid for war-torn regions has been suspended

Disaster relief programs have been dismantled

All of this is being carried out under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom Democrats joined Republicans in unanimously confirming 99-0.

This is not just MAGA cruelty‚Äîit is bipartisan complacency.

6. Igniting a Trade War: Tariffs That Will Crush Consumers
Trump has recklessly imposed a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on all imports from China. These tariffs are scheduled to go live on Tuesday at midnight February 4 Let‚Äôs be clear: Tariffs are not paid by foreign governments or foreign companies. They are paid by American consumers. And unsurprisingly, Canada and Mexico have already announced retaliatory tariffs:

Canada is imposing 25% tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. exports

Mexico is planning tariffs on U.S. pork, cheese, fresh produce, and steel

This will skyrocket prices for consumers while crushing American businesses that rely on exports. Trump either doesn‚Äôt understand basic economics or doesn‚Äôt care how much working people suffer. At a time of historically high wealth and income inequality, this reckless move will further crush working people.

7. The Ideological Purge: Attacking DEI and Silencing Journalists
As I‚Äôve documented before, Trump is purging non-white officials, political opponents, women, and journalists from federal agencies and the Pentagon. Specifically, since taking office, he has:

Canceled student visas for pro-Palestinian protesters, a clear First Amendment violation

Ordered Politico, the New York Times, and NBC to vacate their Pentagon offices, and has replaced them with OANN, Breitbart, and the New York Post‚Äîright wing outlets with a history of bias and disinformation

Attempted to force out federal employees who are not ideologically aligned with the ‚ÄúTrump agenda‚Äù

Purged all DEIA verbiage, actions, and initiatives from all Federal agencies, and openly demonized Black and brown people, disabled people, and women as the cause of America‚Äôs problems

This is not about government reform. It is about creating a one-party fascist state where Trump controls the media, purges opposition, and rules with unchecked power.

How Do We Respond With Meaningful Action?
‚ÄúSo what do we do?‚Äù is a question I receive dozens of times per day. I answer in detail below. To be sure, the worst thing we can do is give up. Autocrats want capitulation through exhaustion and compliance through fear. Do not give them that fuel.

Instead, in response to the 7 fascist actions cited above, I offer below 7 acts we can take to enact meaningful change for justice. Even if you don‚Äôt know where to begin or don‚Äôt have expendable funds, you can play a meaningful role. Some of these action items below have immediate effect and others take time. I ask you to engage in both.

Federal Employees ‚Äî Use All Legal Means At Your Disposal: The eight FBI agent executives and the 17 Inspectors Generals refusing to comply in advance with unlawful firings are two excellent examples to follow. As federal employees, you have rights and protections. Contact employment attorneys in your area and speak to labor rights organizations. Understand your rights and know your rights. Get in good trouble, as John Lewis reminds us. Fight tooth and nail for your position, as your actions set a precedent for the future. Set the precedent of resisting autocratic terminations. Use your full constitutional protections to drag out every case imaginable and clog up the legal system for the Trump regime. If even 10% of the 2.3 million federal employees stand united and resist through the court system, you will slow down Trump autocracy. Do not capitulate to autocracy, combat autocracy with the full power of the law.

Democrats in Congress - Do Something More Than Tweet Your Outrage: Your constituents are angry, tired, and confused at your apathy, silence, and lack of organization. For your convenience, I have a short list of questions that should not be hard to answer:

Who is your party leader who should be coordinating all counter-fascism efforts and calling the shots on how to protect the American people?

Where are the daily press conferences and media blitzes documenting Trump‚Äôs fascism?

Where are the courageous protests by Members of Congress on the Capitol steps like former Congresswoman Cori Bush held in 2020 to protest the end of the rent moratorium during COVID?

Where are the Senate investigations into Trump‚Äôs corruption and Musk‚Äôs illegal access to the Treasury? How are you protecting our sensitive data?

Where are the guidances on what to do if our care is denied or the resources on getting accurate healthcare information removed from the CDC website? Where are the guidances if our SNAP, TANF, or Section 8 is denied?

Where are the barrage of lawsuits to clog up Trump‚Äôs fascist Executive Orders? For example, between lawsuits and floor votes, Republicans have attempted to repeal the ACA more than 100 times, even when in the minority, and now they might finally succeed in doing so. If Republicans can organize this effectively to strip our healthcare, why can‚Äôt you organize even half this effectively to protect our human rights?

Moreover, as Indivisible Co-Executive Director Leah Greenberg excellently said:

Democrats can oppose all Trump nominees, deny unanimous consent to slow senate proceedings, vote no on all cloture, force quorum calls at every chance. It‚Äôs a constitutional crisis. There is absolutely no reason the Senate should be connecting business as usual.

All of the above actions are wholly within Democrat control, even as the minority party‚Äîyet we see virtually none of it. Stop hiding behind the excuse of being a minority party, and start working with the awesome power of Congress afforded to you.

Everyone - Activate: Get involved in your local politics, which affects you more than most realize. Whether it is your local school board, your local city council, or your local immigrant rights organization‚Äîget involved. Show up to the next meeting, meet your local elected officials, and, for example, make sure you have a local policy on how to counter ICE raids in your local schools, shelters, and hospitals. Google is your friend in finding a local calendar of events. Use it.

Everyone - Communicate: Contact your member of Congress (find them here) and relentlessly remind them that you do not support Trump‚Äôs fascist agenda. Even if they are not willing to listen to you, inundate them with calls, texts, and emails. Ensure they hear your outrage as much as possible. Here‚Äôs a sample email to send to protest the illegal FBI firings (and illegal federal terminations in general):

Hi, my name is [insert name] and I live in [city/town/zip code]. I am a constituent of Congressman/Senators [name] and I am calling to strongly oppose the firing of any rank-and-file FBI agents, and any federal civil service employees, that are suspected to happen by the White House and DOJ. 

I am asking Congressman/Senator [name] to contact DOJ and White House leadership to demand they stop any planned action into these unjust firings and forced resignations. Unlike political appointees, line FBI agents are non-partisan federal government employees that are assigned to investigate any allegation of federal crime and they do so without any bias. Firings of these agents sets a dangerous precedent that retribution could take place if a rank-and-file FBI agent investigates a federal crime. This would fundamentally damage the core of our country‚Äôs premier law enforcement agency ‚Äî that justice is blind. In addition, the mass firings of FBI agents would also indefinitely halt thousands of cases into violent criminals and gangs, drug tracking organizations and cartels, and terrorists, which is a something that this Administration has promised to focus on.

I strongly believe civil service protections for line FBI agents help them maintain independence from external influence or pressure from any outside group, person, or political party, no matter what side. This issue is of the upmost priority for my representative to take action on this immediately and is something I will pay close attention to as the upcoming elections come around.
Everyone - Invest: Invest your time and your money into the people and organizations doing the front line work. If you have time to volunteer, make phone calls, knock doors, and sign petitions, do so. If you have the financial resources to donate to organizations working to protect our democracy, especially local orgs, please do so. Even a few dollars a month, if you can afford it, goes a long way. And as always, consider running for office yourself. And especially if you‚Äôre under 40, reach out to Run For Something to get started.

Everyone - Educate: It is critical we remain informed on the key issues, by educating ourselves and those around us. As corporate media sadly continues to capitulate to fascism, support writers and human rights lawyers working to stop fascism in America (e.g. like yours truly). Read the work of non-profit media like ProPublica, The Appeal, and more. We may not have the billions of dollars in autocrat dark money, but we have strength in numbers and your support makes that difference.

Everyone - Organize: Bring friends with you. You are the best ambassador for justice in your friend group‚Äîlead by example. Grab even one friend and drag them with you to the next school board meeting, city council session, next phone banking session to an elected official, or town hall in your local community. We need to build organizational capacity, and means each one reaches one to get involved. This also means consider joining the General Strike that so far nearly 200,000 Americans have joined. The goal is to reach 11 million Americans. You can find out more at GeneralStrikeUS.

Conclusion
The Southern Strategy never stopped. Capitulation to MAGA fascism is made possible because so many are willing to embrace culture wars to distract from economic injustices as long as it gives them the perception of racial superiority over Black and brown people. We need to reject these culture wars and recognize that billionaire oligarchs will undermine the humanity in all of us, left or right, if it makes them a few extra bucks. We need unity in this time of crisis.

The only way to fight back is through relentless resistance, organization, and action, as I‚Äôve described above. It is imperative we remember what justice looks like‚Äîbecause none of this is just‚Äîand continue to fight for that justice. I will continue to document and expose these autocratic attacks as they unfold, and I encourage you to act on the action items mentioned above. Again‚Äîdo not let legality and power be a measure of morality and justice. And finally, I need and welcome your continued support to advance my human rights advocacy.

Resist. Activate. Communicate. Invest. Educate. Organize. Subscribe. And share. Thank you for your trust in this battle for democracy itself.

Girl Scouts are encouraged to discover the needs in their own communities, which helps them understand that ‚Äúfood insecurity can be everywhere and there are a lot of ways they can be involved,‚Äù said Lindy Wood, senior education and outreach manager for Atlanta Community Food Bank.

I've been with the Atlanta Community Food Bank for five years. I recently got my start in the warehouse. Everything that's been going on these last few weeks has been devastating for a lot of people. Not just in the Augusta area, even in Arlington area about people who have gone without power and it's affected people from county to county. Since I've been here, I've seen people walk amongst with open arms. I've seen so much love. It's been a wonderful experience coming here to help the people that are in need, due to the hurricane. It's been amazing to meet different people here and their experiences, hearing how grateful they are. It's actually humble me and more ways than normal. I'm really excited to be here. Hope I get to come again. People coming and dropping off water food, perishable items for like storage and going to a self-career, a minor and going all throughout the Augusta area. I think that this is what we're doing. You know, I've been in IT for four or a few years and this is, I haven't really been able to have any but my boost on the ground.

- Feeding America, Feeding Georgia, Feeding the Carolinas
- Atlanta Community Food Bank
- Food Bank of Northeast Georgia 
- Georgia Mountain Food Bank
- Chattanooga Area Food Bank

The Indianapolis branch of the American Red Cross announced that two volunteers drove an emergency response vehicle to North Carolina on Tuesday to provide relief for those dealing with the aftermath of the storm, which also struck five other southeastern states and caused over 120 deaths.

‚ÄúThis hurricane has caused catastrophic damage, and it extends to hundreds of miles, and has uprooted the lives of communities, and in many cases forever,‚Äù said Isis Chaverri, communications director for the Indiana Region of the American Red Cross.

The volunteers, Cindy Kvale and Dave Barker, will distribute food, water, and other critical emergency supplies to those who need them. They will join 24 other volunteers from Indiana who have already departed to help those in need.

Chaverri said that the Red Cross has now sent 60 emergency response vehicles to areas affected by the hurricane, and that four of those are from Indiana. She said that the volunteers are an important part of bringing relief to communities.

‚ÄúThe volunteers do make a big difference in providing support and comfort to thousands of people who right now, you know, have lost everything,‚Äù she said.

Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana is also providing help to those harmed by the hurricane.

The nonprofit has sent several truckloads of prebuilt disaster boxes to two of its sister food banks in Atlanta and east Tennessee. The boxes are filled with ready to eat items that the food banks will hand out to people who need them.

Gleaners said it expects to continue to support its sister food banks more in the coming weeks.

Midwest Food Bank is offering help to those in the local community affected by power outages that the hurricane caused. The organization will give out food on October 5 at Good Shepherd United Methodist Church in Indianapolis.

Midwest Food Bank has also partnered with the Salvation Army to send food and water to affected states.

The team at Masco Support Services in Georgia toured the Atlanta Community Food Bank to learn more about food insecurity and how their contribution will make a difference.

This donation helps increase access to fresh, healthy produce for families across Georgia. Each year, local farmers donate over 32 million pounds of nutritious, #2 grade produce that may not look perfect but is still perfectly nourishing. With hunger being a critical health issue‚Äîwhere 1 in 3 pantry visitors has a household member with diabetes‚Äîthis support is vital in getting fresh food to those who need it most.

Five days after a global cyber outage, it really caused a mess. Now the US Department of Transportation&#39;s Office of Aviation is stepping in and launching an investigation just hours ago. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on social media platform X that the investigation into Delta Airlines is to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions. He writes, quote, all airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly and I will make sure that right is upheld. 11 0 lives. Ariana Moniz joins us live now from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport, Ariana for days. We&#39;ve been seeing long lines, bandon luggage, piling up what are conditions like for passengers today? That&#39;s right, Chris here in Harville, we&#39;re still seeing some passengers who tell us that they&#39;ve been stranded for days at a time. And we&#39;re also seeing rows and rows of unclaimed luggage while other airlines seem to have been able to recover from Friday&#39;s cyber global outage is still appears that Delta they&#39;re still struggling to get back on track. Now I will say that the airport is not filled with as many travelers as we saw on Monday. But there are still passengers who tell us that they&#39;ve waited for days to get back home or to their destination. And that&#39;s of course due to the ongoing delays and cancellations that we still see here at heart. So now at last check, there have been 211 cancellations here at Hearts today and 203 of those flights are Delta Airlines. And that&#39;s according to and on Monday, a little under 2500 flights were canceled and under 1100 Delta flights. Now we spoke to a traveler who has been caught up in the ongoing travel disruptions. She says that she&#39;s just trying to get back home to Arizona but said she&#39;s found herself stuck here at the airport or sitting on planes going nowhere for hours. Take a listen. So I had a layover here in Atlanta and they boarded us on the plane and we sat there for three hours. Apparently, you are not allowed to sit on a plane longer than three hours. So we de boarded a couple hours later, they put us on a new plane where we sat for about 90 minutes and actually got to the tarmac, but then the pilot timed out. So we drove back to the gate, got off and about 4 a.m. they canceled our flight. So my luggage is still on that flight. So I&#39;m trying to find my way to my luggage in Reno. And that&#39;s also the story. Once passengers do arrive to their destination, some are left without their luggage and luggage is now really crowding the airport. We seeing back fill the upper level balcony and rows and rows of backs. They&#39;re lined up between Delta baggage claim carousel for passengers whose flights have been disrupted for days at a time. Yesterday, we were able to be on the upper level balcony but we have been unable to be in that area because it&#39;s now filled with bags. Now amid this ongoing investigation by the Department of Transportation, the agency secretary Pete Buttigieg, he&#39;s first encouraging passengers to try to resolve any issues that they&#39;re having first with the airline. But if they feel that Delta is not complying with the agen agency passenger protection requirements, he&#39;s encouraging passengers to then file a complaint with the Department of Transportation reporting live from Hart Jackson International Airport. I for the life back to so many people trying to reunite with luggage or families are on a thank you for more information about flight delays and cancellations. Text the word delays to the number 404885 7600.

The demand is already pent up for this kind of resource. The hope is this direct relief will ease the burden on local families helping extend budgets overall so they can address transportation, child care. There&#39;s so many things that you have to have to be sustained as a household and we just want to help them, give them a little more margin to solve those other problems in Jonesboro, Liza Lucas 11 Alive News. Not only is there really a need here for more resources to meet the need. There&#39;s also a need for volunteers.

#HungerWalk #CommunitySupport"," Sunday, March 10th, folks. It is the 40th annual Hunger Walk Run. Atlanta Food Bank annual event and it's going to be a nice one. Happy to report that to you. The sunshine is going to break back out for the latter half of the weekend. So we're looking good. We may start off with a few clouds in the morning, but other than that, we'll get that sunshine in the afternoon. 45 degrees start. The event itself starts at the Home Depot Backyard at noon. That's where registration will take place. The actual walk run takes place at two o'clock. Temperatures right at 52 degrees by noon. On our way to near 60 for an afternoon high. In fact, by the time the event ends by four o'clock will be at 58 degrees. If you're going to be hanging out talking about your time that you walk or ran 56 degrees will be our temperature by the time we hit six o'clock. It's going to be a great event. Have some fun out there folks. And don't over exert yourself a little bit. Have some fun while you're helping out our neighbors.",no longer populated,,2024-03-09T14:00:48.000Z,post data removed,,25,0,1,241,,

Thanks to the generosity of our attendees, exhibitors, and partners like Hawkins, Inc., WATT Global Media, Expo Auctions, and B and B Glass Studio/The Glass House, we're providing over 100,000 meals to families facing food insecurity in Atlanta Metro and Northern Georgia.

Since 2016, our 'Giving Back to Atlanta' campaign has donated over $213,000 to support those in need. This achievement underscores the commitment of the feed, meat, poultry, and egg industries to feeding the world healthy, sustainable food.

A huge thank you to everyone involved in making this contribution possible!
