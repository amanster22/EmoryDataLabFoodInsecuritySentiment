Elisha Dumas recently became the owner of a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home along the James P. Brawley corridor in the English Avenue neighborhood through WFF’s signature affordable housing initiative, Home on the Westside.

Dumas’s role as an employee at Mercedes-Benz Stadium perfectly aligns with WFF’s community retention guidelines, which prioritize housing for individuals with live, work and learn connections to the historic Westside. Dumas received a combined $110,000 in down payment and financial assistance from WFF, Invest Atlanta and Atlanta Housing — turning his dream of homeownership into reality.

Congratulations, Elisha!

And many other community partners"," This is more than just the opening of a residential building. It's the beginning of new opportunities, renewed hope, and lasting change in the lives of so many individuals in our communities. Tamarose's mission is to provide safe, affordable, and service-oriented housing. We are extremely excited to be chosen by St. Joseph's Mercy Care to be their partner in this awesome development. Our mission is about facilitating transformative healing. When the Sisters of Mercy came to Atlanta, they built Atlanta's first hospital, St. Joseph's in primary. They asked what do the poor and vulnerable citizens of this community need. In their decision was not just a desire to live out their faith and beliefs, but also the courage to do what had not been done before. To push the envelope and to drive innovation to those who are usually the last to benefit from it. I remember when we did the groundbreaking and I saw it as it was under construction, and I got excited. It's great to be standing on top of this rooftop to look at the views that residents will have. This project represents a significant step towards addressing the national affordable housing crisis. The residents of Macauley station will have access to Mercy Care medical services because in my determination, housing is health care. And let's not forget, let's born and come. So this is phase one, this is a beautiful all ready. So thank you, thank you, thank you for delivering all your promise. This is near and near the Mont Arct because my entire being, if you will, literally in shadows where we stand right now. My schooling, my church, my hospital, all of it, within probably one mile radius of year. What a whole circle moment for me to come back to a half years later and see this building and see this community that has risen from this gravel lot. We're proud to partner with everyone here at Provide Homes and a community for 170 families. Next in the last year, we have committed over $300 million to affordable housing here at Mont Arct. We're only here on this place for a very small period of time. This is the bottom legacy that we're going to live behind to say, at the end of the day, I feel all I can to make a difference. Affordable housing, as we know, is very critical and in an investor plan, we really see housing as a spectrum of need from homeless to home ownership, do everything in between to ensure that whatever you want to choose as a place or how you want to live, you can find that option here in the city of Atlanta. This development, it stands as a testament to the dedication, the commitment, and the hard work of all of our partners. Together we're building strong communities and brighter futures, so thank you all for being here to celebrate this milestone. May this be a safe place, all of understanding and acceptance, where you can be as you are. May this home be a place of discovery.

For the last several months, these business owners have gone through extensive training to learn  the local, state, and federal procurement processes and have been connected to industry leaders for real-time workshops and training.

Currently, only 1.6% of federal contracts go to Black-owned businesses. We’re focused on improving that number. Last week, we celebrated businesses that were awarded the first contracts, those who’ve won their largest contracts to date, and everything in between. 

We do this work with wellness serving as the anchor. As we focus on scaling businesses, we know you cannot neglect to scale your mindset and create a nurturing environment for yourself.

I couldn’t be more proud of my team at @ourvillageunited and our partners at the City of Atlanta, APS, Invest Atlanta, SBA, and many more!

Many congratulations to our pitch winners and every Villager. 

Thank you @shedoeverything for being our guest speaker in both cities. You are incredible, and I am thankful for your sisterhood.

Thank you  @sheoykialexis for ensuring we had a beautiful experience.

The fund is a joint effort between the city and Invest Atlanta.,"Right now, applications are being accepted for a $10 million fund hoping to help senior citizen homeowners in Atlanta pay their property taxes. Now, the fund is a joint effort between the city of Atlanta and invest Atlanta level line. Erika Murphy has details on who is eligible to apply. It is uh good for programs to be implemented that will help people feel like you are at home and you don&#39;t have to be forced out. Long time. Resident Alona Park says it&#39;s good to see. Help is on the way for seniors struggling to pay rising property tax bills that a lot of people have sold their property. Uh and then those that have stayed. A lot of them have been kind of iffy because the property taxes have risen. Invest Atlanta recently opened applications for the anti displacement tax relief fund program which is centered around helping legacy residents like parks pay rising property taxes. So what we are going to do here is we&#39;re gonna create a ceiling for the senior meaning once they enter into the program, they will have their tax rate and they for the next 20 years will not pay more than their current tax rate. 200 people will be chosen, the applicants who are accepted will be notified in the mail. Invest Atlanta president and Ceo Doctor Eloisa Clemente says not everyone will be eligible because the pilot is for certain neighborhoods and for people who are current on their property taxes. There are two programs that are available to them. Right now. The first program pays for delinquent taxes and that program if they have questions can call constituent services at the city Atlanta for the anti displacement tax relief fund, applicants must be at least 60 years old have lived in the city of Atlanta since at least 2015 and meet certain income requirements. Invest Atlanta will accept applications until August 17th. Reporting from Atlanta, Erica Murphy 11 Alive News. All right. So homeowners in several Atlanta neighborhoods are eligible to see that full list. Head to our website. You love it, alive.com.

Now, Jennifer defense attorneys say they&#39;re hoping for bond modifications or a mistrial, but prosecutors want a gag order. 11 alive. S Grace King explains what&#39;s at stake. Well, that&#39;s why I guess Judge Paige Whitaker wasting no time in her new role overseeing the yo trial. Judge Whittaker has got to review his much of the case as she can so she can be on board and know what she&#39;s ruling on this week. Attorneys for four of the six co defendants filed motions for mistrials. What I say is not necessarily what I do. Attorney Darryl Cohen, who isn&#39;t affiliated with this case tells 11 alive. Those requests are likely more strategic than anything. Their lawyers don&#39;t want to go through it again. So asking you for a mistrial is really more setting a record for appeal if they are convicted. In the meantime, three of those defendants are also asking to get out on bond. It&#39;s been so long they&#39;re alleging that because they&#39;ve been incarcerated for so long that they&#39;re not getting justice the way justice is meant to be. Prosecutors are also weighing in on how the case should proceed. They filed a new motion for a gag order. What the das office or the prosecutors are probably trying to do is stop the defense from trying their case. In the court of public opinion. Judge Whitaker will begin hearing these motions Tuesday morning. She hopes to get through them pretty quickly so they can resume trial in early August in downtown Atlanta.

But we have some good news for you. This midday beginning today, you can officially apply for those relief grants for business owners. The Steamhouse Lounge on 10 and Peachtree was one of thousands of businesses that had to shut down for several days because of the break. They lost thousands of dollars in revenue. The water main break was right directly in front of our restaurant. Uh We didn&#39;t receive any damage, luckily, but our staff was out of work for a week and it was actually financially pretty hard for them if the Steamhouse Lounge is selected. She says they use the funding to support their staff. Another business owner we talked to says he lost about $9000 in the water crisis but is grateful the city is allocating the $7.5 million to help. I commend Andre Mayor Dickens, uh I commend uh Doctor Eloisa Clemente from Invest Atlanta council member, Wes Moreland that all came together to create this program to help support small businesses like ours. So here are some important dates. You need to know if you plan to apply today in two weeks, the application process will close on July 8th. You&#39;ll find out if you&#39;re awarded the funding starting July 29th. The second thing to know is you have to meet some criteria in order to apply application rankings will also be considered the number of days you were impacted and priority will be given to the industries most severely impact it. Also about nine things you&#39;ll need to have when you go to fill out your application today, that includes your business license, Georgia Secretary of State registration and a notarized save affidavit.

The lives. Caitlyn Ross is live tonight at one of those businesses that had just opened its doors when it was forced to close down Caitlin. Exactly. Jonathan storehouse vegan owners tell me they feel fortunate that they&#39;re able to open their doors because so many people on this block cannot, they suffered a water main break and do have damage in both their basement and their walk in freezer. But they say they&#39;re still able to serve their customers. That&#39;s not the case for so many of these small businesses that suffered really extensive damage. I talked to the owner of Big Dave&#39;s Cheesesteaks earlier today. He says he&#39;s not sure they&#39;ll ever be able to reopen their doors just because of how much damage that water main break caused. Business owners say they need help, they need financial assistance to recoup some of those losses and to fix some of the damage done by that burst. It&#39;s been a tough situation because it&#39;s not just the labor issues or the missing of revenue. It&#39;s, it&#39;s also mechanical issues that have occurred due to the, you know, the water main break happening. So it&#39;s been really tough, really tough is right for so many of these business owners, the city just today released a proposal that would give $5 million in relief to businesses within Atlanta who were impacted by that water main break. The details though are still being worked out as to who gets what money, how it&#39;s divided. The city council is going to vote on that proposal this coming Monday. And after that, the business owners say they&#39;ll be grateful for whatever relief they can get reporting live downtown Caitlin, Ross, 11 live news. All right, Kaitlin. So thanks so much. And as you said, really, the city is still deciding how this money will all be divvied out. So we&#39;ll have to just wait and see. Thanks. So.

in Atlanta who fear they may be forced

ago. So now there&#39;s a, a new
program hoping to
help them out through a partnership
with the city. The nonprofit organization
called Star C is launching an eviction
prevention program. They will be receiving more than $2 million to help out those
Atlanta families. The city council is expected to
approve that funding
on Monday. There are thousands upon
thousands of evictions that
are on the books right now and more are being filed
every day at its most

A few weeks ago, Perry reached out to Atlanta Mayor Andrew Dickens about providing assistance for those residents on fixed incomes who could lose their homes as a result of rising real estate taxes, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Perry, ranked third among the world’s highest-paid entertainers by Forbes, is going to pay the back property taxes for 300 low-income seniors in Atlanta, the newspaper said.

The assistance will cover city, county and school taxes. Perry will also cover any increase in taxes over the next 20 years for 100 low-income older residents. He has already donated $750,000 for the first year to cover the back taxes and any increase in property taxes, and has pledged $500,000 each year over the next four years to ensure the residents don’t pay any more in such taxes.

The funds will be administered by Invest Atlanta Partnership, the nonprofit wing of Atlanta’s economic development authority.

National Church Residences and True Light Baptist Church are partnering to build a $24 million affordable housing community in Atlanta's Westside neighborhood. True Light Haven will have 124 units on the 295 Penelope Drive property and will offer independent senior living in one and two bedroom apartments. We know that we need more affordable housing in Fulton County, so for this property to be built in District 4 it means so much to me. The Westside needs it like all the rest of Atlanta needs it. We can't build enough fast enough and we're just thrilled to be starting this first step. National Church Residences has nine senior communities in Atlanta, Metro area. The Not-for-profit organization serves more than 42,000 seniors through its array of housing and healthcare services.",no longer populated,,2020-03-03T19:24:30.000Z,post data removed,,19,0,1,0,,
